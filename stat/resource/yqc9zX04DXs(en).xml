<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="16.109" dur="2.151">First, a video.</text><text start="24.657" dur="2.802">Yes, it is a scrambled egg.</text><text start="29.411" dur="1.333">But as you look at it,</text><text start="30.768" dur="4.111">I hope you&amp;#39;ll begin to feel
just slightly uneasy.</text><text start="36.649" dur="3.338">Because you may notice
that what&amp;#39;s actually happening</text><text start="40.011" dur="2.225">is that the egg is unscrambling itself.</text><text start="42.26" dur="2.699">And you&amp;#39;ll now see the yolk
and the white have separated.</text><text start="44.983" dur="3.023">And now they&amp;#39;re going to be
poured back into the egg.</text><text start="48.03" dur="2.468">And we all know in our heart of hearts</text><text start="50.522" dur="3.015">that this is not the way
the universe works.</text><text start="54.696" dur="3.105">A scrambled egg is mush --
tasty mush -- but it&amp;#39;s mush.</text><text start="57.825" dur="2.411">An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing</text><text start="60.26" dur="2.239">that can create even more
sophisticated things,</text><text start="62.523" dur="1.317">such as chickens.</text><text start="64.332" dur="1.904">And we know in our heart of hearts</text><text start="66.26" dur="3.764">that the universe does not travel
from mush to complexity.</text><text start="70.45" dur="2.395">In fact, this gut instinct</text><text start="72.869" dur="2.872">is reflected in one of the most
fundamental laws of physics,</text><text start="75.765" dur="2.825">the second law of thermodynamics,
or the law of entropy.</text><text start="79.162" dur="1.759">What that says basically</text><text start="80.945" dur="3.127">is that the general
tendency of the universe</text><text start="84.096" dur="3.603">is to move from order and structure</text><text start="87.723" dur="2.664">to lack of order, lack of structure --</text><text start="90.411" dur="1.464">in fact, to mush.</text><text start="91.899" dur="3.223">And that&amp;#39;s why that video
feels a bit strange.</text><text start="95.685" dur="2.729">And yet, look around us.</text><text start="99.454" dur="3.476">What we see around us
is staggering complexity.</text><text start="103.549" dur="3.289">Eric Beinhocker estimates
that in New York City alone,</text><text start="106.862" dur="3.554">there are some 10 billion SKUs,
or distinct commodities, being traded.</text><text start="110.932" dur="3.968">That&amp;#39;s hundreds of times
as many species as there are on Earth.</text><text start="115.26" dur="3.976">And they&amp;#39;re being traded by a species
of almost seven billion individuals,</text><text start="119.26" dur="3.385">who are linked by trade,
travel, and the Internet</text><text start="122.669" dur="3.689">into a global system
of stupendous complexity.</text><text start="127.826" dur="1.476">So here&amp;#39;s a great puzzle:</text><text start="130.191" dur="4.647">in a universe ruled
by the second law of thermodynamics,</text><text start="134.862" dur="1.804">how is it possible</text><text start="136.69" dur="2.546">to generate the sort
of complexity I&amp;#39;ve described,</text><text start="139.26" dur="3.788">the sort of complexity
represented by you and me</text><text start="143.072" dur="1.689">and the convention center?</text><text start="146.119" dur="1.953">Well, the answer seems to be,</text><text start="148.096" dur="3.14">the universe can create complexity,</text><text start="151.26" dur="1.555">but with great difficulty.</text><text start="153.87" dur="1.097">In pockets,</text><text start="154.991" dur="2.317">there appear
what my colleague, Fred Spier,</text><text start="157.332" dur="2.142">calls &amp;quot;Goldilocks conditions&amp;quot; --</text><text start="159.498" dur="2.051">not too hot, not too cold,</text><text start="161.573" dur="2.663">just right for the creation of complexity.</text><text start="164.26" dur="2.267">And slightly more complex things appear.</text><text start="166.551" dur="2.239">And where you have
slightly more complex things,</text><text start="168.814" dur="2.372">you can get slightly more complex things.</text><text start="171.21" dur="4.026">And in this way, complexity
builds stage by stage.</text><text start="176.135" dur="2.278">Each stage is magical</text><text start="178.437" dur="3.573">because it creates the impression
of something utterly new</text><text start="182.034" dur="2.803">appearing almost out of nowhere
in the universe.</text><text start="184.861" dur="3.231">We refer in big history to these moments
as threshold moments.</text><text start="189.131" dur="3.105">And at each threshold,
the going gets tougher.</text><text start="192.26" dur="3.242">The complex things get more fragile,</text><text start="195.526" dur="1.71">more vulnerable;</text><text start="197.26" dur="3.531">the Goldilocks conditions
get more stringent,</text><text start="200.815" dur="2.987">and it&amp;#39;s more difficult
to create complexity.</text><text start="204.728" dur="3.304">Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,</text><text start="208.056" dur="2.18">desperately need to know this story</text><text start="210.26" dur="4.658">of how the universe creates complexity
despite the second law,</text><text start="214.942" dur="5.032">and why complexity means
vulnerability and fragility.</text><text start="220.745" dur="2.92">And that&amp;#39;s the story
that we tell in big history.</text><text start="223.689" dur="1.707">But to do it, you have do something</text><text start="225.42" dur="2.705">that may, at first sight,
seem completely impossible.</text><text start="228.149" dur="3.18">You have to survey the whole
history of the universe.</text><text start="232.748" dur="1">So let&amp;#39;s do it.</text><text start="234.26" dur="1.909">(Laughter)</text><text start="236.193" dur="3.446">Let&amp;#39;s begin by winding the timeline back</text><text start="239.663" dur="2.896">13.7 billion years,</text><text start="242.583" dur="2.677">to the beginning of time.</text><text start="252.581" dur="1.654">Around us, there&amp;#39;s nothing.</text><text start="254.986" dur="2.706">There&amp;#39;s not even time or space.</text><text start="258.474" dur="3.698">Imagine the darkest,
emptiest thing you can</text><text start="262.196" dur="3.317">and cube it a gazillion times
and that&amp;#39;s where we are.</text><text start="265.992" dur="2.34">And then suddenly,</text><text start="268.356" dur="1.008">bang!</text><text start="269.388" dur="2.207">A universe appears, an entire universe.</text><text start="271.619" dur="1.856">And we&amp;#39;ve crossed our first threshold.</text><text start="273.499" dur="2.373">The universe is tiny;
it&amp;#39;s smaller than an atom.</text><text start="275.896" dur="1.34">It&amp;#39;s incredibly hot.</text><text start="277.26" dur="2.525">It contains everything
that&amp;#39;s in today&amp;#39;s universe,</text><text start="279.809" dur="1.794">so you can imagine, it&amp;#39;s busting.</text><text start="281.627" dur="2.609">And it&amp;#39;s expanding at incredible speed.</text><text start="284.26" dur="1.913">And at first, it&amp;#39;s just a blur,</text><text start="286.197" dur="3.11">but very quickly distinct things
begin to appear in that blur.</text><text start="289.743" dur="1.493">Within the first second,</text><text start="291.26" dur="2.976">energy itself shatters
into distinct forces</text><text start="294.26" dur="3.082">including electromagnetism and gravity.</text><text start="297.366" dur="2.428">And energy does something
else quite magical:</text><text start="299.818" dur="3.232">it congeals to form matter --</text><text start="303.074" dur="2.33">quarks that will create protons</text><text start="305.428" dur="2.138">and leptons that include electrons.</text><text start="307.59" dur="2.103">And all of that happens
in the first second.</text><text start="309.717" dur="4.229">Now we move forward 380,000 years.</text><text start="314.26" dur="3.647">That&amp;#39;s twice as long as humans
have been on this planet.</text><text start="317.931" dur="4.74">And now simple atoms appear
of hydrogen and helium.</text><text start="323.877" dur="1.603">Now I want to pause for a moment,</text><text start="325.504" dur="2.732">380,000 years after the origins
of the universe,</text><text start="328.26" dur="3.976">because we actually know quite a lot
about the universe at this stage.</text><text start="332.773" dur="2.921">We know above all
that it was extremely simple.</text><text start="335.718" dur="3.799">It consisted of huge clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms,</text><text start="339.541" dur="1.928">and they have no structure.</text><text start="341.493" dur="2.367">They&amp;#39;re really a sort of cosmic mush.</text><text start="344.652" dur="1.67">But that&amp;#39;s not completely true.</text><text start="346.732" dur="1.504">Recent studies</text><text start="348.26" dur="2.861">by satellites such as the WMAP satellite</text><text start="351.145" dur="1.577">have shown that, in fact,</text><text start="352.746" dur="2.749">there are just tiny differences
in that background.</text><text start="355.519" dur="1.717">What you see here,</text><text start="357.26" dur="4.306">the blue areas are about a thousandth
of a degree cooler</text><text start="361.59" dur="1.392">than the red areas.</text><text start="363.006" dur="1.373">These are tiny differences,</text><text start="364.403" dur="2.27">but it was enough
for the universe to move on</text><text start="366.697" dur="1.975">to the next stage of building complexity.</text><text start="368.696" dur="1.192">And this is how it works.</text><text start="370.895" dur="4.248">Gravity is more powerful
where there&amp;#39;s more stuff.</text><text start="375.817" dur="2.318">So where you get slightly denser areas,</text><text start="378.159" dur="3.917">gravity starts compacting clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms.</text><text start="382.1" dur="3.55">So we can imagine the early universe
breaking up into a billion clouds.</text><text start="385.674" dur="1.802">And each cloud is compacted,</text><text start="387.5" dur="3.016">gravity gets more powerful
as density increases,</text><text start="390.54" dur="3.094">the temperature begins to rise
at the center of each cloud,</text><text start="393.658" dur="1.289">and then, at the center,</text><text start="394.971" dur="2.838">the temperature crosses
the threshold temperature</text><text start="397.833" dur="1.566">of 10 million degrees,</text><text start="399.423" dur="2.405">protons start to fuse,</text><text start="401.852" dur="2.384">there&amp;#39;s a huge release of energy,</text><text start="404.26" dur="1.433">and --</text><text start="405.717" dur="1.016">bam!</text><text start="406.757" dur="1.515">We have our first stars.</text><text start="408.938" dur="3.858">From about 200 million years
after the Big Bang,</text><text start="412.82" dur="3.407">stars begin to appear
all through the universe,</text><text start="416.251" dur="1.071">billions of them.</text><text start="417.759" dur="2.856">And the universe is now
significantly more interesting</text><text start="420.639" dur="1.095">and more complex.</text><text start="423.188" dur="3.116">Stars will create
the Goldilocks conditions</text><text start="426.328" dur="1.899">for crossing two new thresholds.</text><text start="428.631" dur="2.579">When very large stars die,</text><text start="431.234" dur="2.321">they create temperatures so high</text><text start="433.579" dur="3.633">that protons begin to fuse
in all sorts of exotic combinations,</text><text start="437.236" dur="2.83">to form all the elements
of the periodic table.</text><text start="440.09" dur="2.296">If, like me, you&amp;#39;re wearing a gold ring,</text><text start="442.41" dur="2.826">it was forged in a supernova explosion.</text><text start="445.878" dur="3.199">So now the universe
is chemically more complex.</text><text start="449.101" dur="2.365">And in a chemically more complex universe,</text><text start="451.49" dur="2.444">it&amp;#39;s possible to make more things.</text><text start="453.958" dur="3.492">And what starts happening
is that, around young suns,</text><text start="457.474" dur="1.762">young stars,</text><text start="459.26" dur="2.191">all these elements combine,
they swirl around,</text><text start="461.475" dur="2.78">the energy of the star stirs them around,</text><text start="464.279" dur="4.725">they form particles, they form snowflakes,
they form little dust motes,</text><text start="469.028" dur="2.196">they form rocks, they form asteroids,</text><text start="471.248" dur="2.595">and eventually,
they form planets and moons.</text><text start="473.867" dur="2.95">And that is how our
solar system was formed,</text><text start="476.841" dur="2.395">four and a half billion years ago.</text><text start="480.453" dur="5.373">Rocky planets like our Earth
are significantly more complex than stars</text><text start="485.85" dur="2.762">because they contain
a much greater diversity of materials.</text><text start="488.636" dur="2.781">So we&amp;#39;ve crossed a fourth
threshold of complexity.</text><text start="492.931" dur="2.627">Now, the going gets tougher.</text><text start="496.411" dur="4.278">The next stage introduces entities
that are significantly more fragile,</text><text start="500.713" dur="1.912">significantly more vulnerable,</text><text start="502.649" dur="2.587">but they&amp;#39;re also much more creative</text><text start="505.26" dur="2.976">and much more capable
of generating further complexity.</text><text start="508.606" dur="3.424">I&amp;#39;m talking, of course,
about living organisms.</text><text start="512.734" dur="2.143">Living organisms are created by chemistry.</text><text start="514.901" dur="2.383">We are huge packages of chemicals.</text><text start="518.115" dur="3.121">So, chemistry is dominated
by the electromagnetic force.</text><text start="521.26" dur="2.239">That operates over smaller
scales than gravity,</text><text start="523.523" dur="3.915">which explains why you and I
are smaller than stars or planets.</text><text start="528.033" dur="2.294">Now, what are the ideal
conditions for chemistry?</text><text start="530.874" dur="1.77">What are the Goldilocks conditions?</text><text start="532.668" dur="2.357">Well, first, you need energy,</text><text start="535.049" dur="1.187">but not too much.</text><text start="536.665" dur="2.255">In the center of a star,
there&amp;#39;s so much energy</text><text start="538.944" dur="3.142">that any atoms that combine
will just get busted apart again.</text><text start="542.11" dur="1.126">But not too little.</text><text start="543.642" dur="1.231">In intergalactic space,</text><text start="544.897" dur="2.883">there&amp;#39;s so little energy
that atoms can&amp;#39;t combine.</text><text start="548.378" dur="1.858">What you want is just the right amount,</text><text start="550.26" dur="2">and planets, it turns out, are just right,</text><text start="552.284" dur="2.507">because they&amp;#39;re close to stars,
but not too close.</text><text start="555.394" dur="3.595">You also need a great diversity
of chemical elements,</text><text start="559.013" dur="3.008">and you need liquids, such as water.</text><text start="562.045" dur="1.047">Why?</text><text start="563.116" dur="3.872">Well, in gases, atoms move
past each other so fast</text><text start="567.012" dur="1.453">that they can&amp;#39;t hitch up.</text><text start="568.95" dur="1.722">In solids,</text><text start="570.696" dur="2.54">atoms are stuck together, they can&amp;#39;t move.</text><text start="573.26" dur="1.718">In liquids,</text><text start="575.002" dur="3.038">they can cruise and cuddle</text><text start="578.064" dur="2.302">and link up to form molecules.</text><text start="581.04" dur="2.355">Now, where do you find
such Goldilocks conditions?</text><text start="583.934" dur="1.992">Well, planets are great,</text><text start="585.95" dur="3.286">and our early Earth was almost perfect.</text><text start="590.037" dur="2.048">It was just the right
distance from its star</text><text start="592.109" dur="2.127">to contain huge oceans of liquid water.</text><text start="594.26" dur="1.976">And deep beneath those oceans,</text><text start="596.26" dur="1.976">at cracks in the Earth&amp;#39;s crust,</text><text start="598.26" dur="2.976">you&amp;#39;ve got heat seeping up
from inside the Earth,</text><text start="601.26" dur="2.127">and you&amp;#39;ve got a great
diversity of elements.</text><text start="603.411" dur="2.546">So at those deep oceanic vents,</text><text start="605.981" dur="2.255">fantastic chemistry began to happen,</text><text start="608.26" dur="3">and atoms combined in all sorts
of exotic combinations.</text><text start="612.26" dur="4.365">But of course, life is more
than just exotic chemistry.</text><text start="617.054" dur="3.757">How do you stabilize those huge molecules</text><text start="620.835" dur="1.357">that seem to be viable?</text><text start="622.95" dur="4.356">Well, it&amp;#39;s here that life introduces
an entirely new trick.</text><text start="628.22" dur="2.535">You don&amp;#39;t stabilize the individual;</text><text start="630.779" dur="2.103">you stabilize the template,</text><text start="632.906" dur="2.105">the thing that carries information,</text><text start="635.035" dur="2.217">and you allow the template to copy itself.</text><text start="637.276" dur="3.151">And DNA, of course,
is the beautiful molecule</text><text start="640.451" dur="2.326">that contains that information.</text><text start="642.801" dur="2.815">You&amp;#39;ll be familiar
with the double helix of DNA.</text><text start="645.64" dur="2.516">Each rung contains information.</text><text start="648.18" dur="4.573">So, DNA contains information
about how to make living organisms.</text><text start="653.315" dur="1.924">And DNA also copies itself.</text><text start="655.263" dur="1.206">So, it copies itself</text><text start="656.493" dur="2.682">and scatters the templates
through the ocean.</text><text start="659.199" dur="1.794">So the information spreads.</text><text start="661.017" dur="2.638">Notice that information
has become part of our story.</text><text start="664.137" dur="3.645">The real beauty of DNA though
is in its imperfections.</text><text start="667.806" dur="3.928">As it copies itself,
once in every billion rungs,</text><text start="671.758" dur="1.745">there tends to be an error.</text><text start="673.527" dur="4.709">And what that means
is that DNA is, in effect, learning.</text><text start="678.26" dur="3.32">It&amp;#39;s accumulating new ways
of making living organisms</text><text start="681.604" dur="1.62">because some of those errors work.</text><text start="683.248" dur="1.198">So DNA&amp;#39;s learning</text><text start="684.47" dur="3.234">and it&amp;#39;s building greater
diversity and greater complexity.</text><text start="687.728" dur="3.182">And we can see this happening
over the last four billion years.</text><text start="690.934" dur="2.175">For most of that time of life on Earth,</text><text start="693.133" dur="2.237">living organisms have been
relatively simple --</text><text start="695.394" dur="1.388">single cells.</text><text start="696.806" dur="3.43">But they had great diversity,
and, inside, great complexity.</text><text start="700.671" dur="2.904">Then from about 600
to 800 million years ago,</text><text start="703.599" dur="2.091">multi-celled organisms appear.</text><text start="705.714" dur="2.501">You get fungi, you get fish,</text><text start="708.239" dur="1.515">you get plants,</text><text start="709.778" dur="2.711">you get amphibia, you get reptiles,</text><text start="712.513" dur="2.43">and then, of course,
you get the dinosaurs.</text><text start="715.999" dur="2.509">And occasionally, there are disasters.</text><text start="719.586" dur="2.389">Sixty-five million years ago,</text><text start="721.999" dur="1.964">an asteroid landed on Earth</text><text start="723.987" dur="1.79">near the Yucatan Peninsula,</text><text start="725.801" dur="2.968">creating conditions equivalent
to those of a nuclear war,</text><text start="728.793" dur="1.889">and the dinosaurs were wiped out.</text><text start="731.166" dur="3.07">Terrible news for the dinosaurs,</text><text start="734.26" dur="3.755">but great news
for our mammalian ancestors,</text><text start="738.039" dur="1.197">who flourished</text><text start="739.26" dur="3.657">in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.</text><text start="742.941" dur="5.055">And we human beings are part
of that creative evolutionary pulse</text><text start="748.02" dur="2.336">that began 65 million years ago</text><text start="750.38" dur="1.88">with the landing of an asteroid.</text><text start="753.796" dur="2.714">Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.</text><text start="756.534" dur="4.348">And I believe we count
as a threshold in this great story.</text><text start="760.906" dur="1.207">Let me explain why.</text><text start="762.7" dur="3.031">We&amp;#39;ve seen that DNA learns in a sense,</text><text start="765.755" dur="1.787">it accumulates information.</text><text start="767.566" dur="1.67">But it is so slow.</text><text start="770.128" dur="3.472">DNA accumulates information
through random errors,</text><text start="773.624" dur="2.136">some of which just happen to work.</text><text start="776.49" dur="2.634">But DNA had actually generated
a faster way of learning:</text><text start="779.148" dur="2.778">it had produced organisms with brains,</text><text start="781.95" dur="3.219">and those organisms
can learn in real time.</text><text start="785.193" dur="2.326">They accumulate information, they learn.</text><text start="787.543" dur="2.825">The sad thing is, when they die,</text><text start="790.392" dur="1.698">the information dies with them.</text><text start="792.479" dur="3.987">Now what makes humans different
is human language.</text><text start="796.49" dur="2.763">We are blessed with a language,
a system of communication,</text><text start="799.277" dur="2.621">so powerful and so precise</text><text start="801.922" dur="3.158">that we can share what we&amp;#39;ve learned
with such precision</text><text start="805.104" dur="2.889">that it can accumulate
in the collective memory.</text><text start="808.017" dur="1.219">And that means</text><text start="809.26" dur="3.779">it can outlast the individuals
who learned that information,</text><text start="813.063" dur="3.173">and it can accumulate
from generation to generation.</text><text start="816.26" dur="4.056">And that&amp;#39;s why, as a species,
we&amp;#39;re so creative and so powerful,</text><text start="820.34" dur="2.056">and that&amp;#39;s why we have a history.</text><text start="823.015" dur="3.301">We seem to be the only species
in four billion years</text><text start="826.34" dur="1.242">to have this gift.</text><text start="828.057" dur="3.565">I call this ability collective learning.</text><text start="831.995" dur="1.389">It&amp;#39;s what makes us different.</text><text start="833.686" dur="3.55">We can see it at work
in the earliest stages of human history.</text><text start="837.949" dur="3.287">We evolved as a species
in the savanna lands of Africa,</text><text start="841.26" dur="3.46">but then you see humans migrating
into new environments,</text><text start="844.744" dur="2.15">into desert lands, into jungles,</text><text start="846.918" dur="2.436">into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --</text><text start="849.378" dur="1.445">tough, tough environment --</text><text start="850.847" dur="2.333">into the Americas, into Australasia.</text><text start="853.204" dur="2.037">Each migration involved learning --</text><text start="855.265" dur="2.483">learning new ways of exploiting
the environment,</text><text start="857.772" dur="2.174">new ways of dealing
with their surroundings.</text><text start="859.97" dur="1.816">Then 10,000 years ago,</text><text start="861.81" dur="2.995">exploiting a sudden
change in global climate</text><text start="864.829" dur="1.572">with the end of the last ice age,</text><text start="866.425" dur="1.581">humans learned to farm.</text><text start="868.623" dur="2.436">Farming was an energy bonanza.</text><text start="871.083" dur="3.827">And exploiting that energy,
human populations multiplied.</text><text start="874.934" dur="3.587">Human societies got larger,
denser, more interconnected.</text><text start="879.101" dur="3.351">And then from about 500 years ago,</text><text start="882.476" dur="2.039">humans began to link up globally</text><text start="884.539" dur="2.381">through shipping, through trains,</text><text start="886.944" dur="2.292">through telegraph, through the Internet,</text><text start="889.26" dur="5.191">until now we seem to form
a single global brain</text><text start="894.475" dur="2.132">of almost seven billion individuals.</text><text start="896.631" dur="3.162">And that brain is learning at warp speed.</text><text start="900.572" dur="2.572">And in the last 200 years,
something else has happened.</text><text start="903.168" dur="2.666">We&amp;#39;ve stumbled on another energy bonanza</text><text start="905.858" dur="1.127">in fossil fuels.</text><text start="907.009" dur="2.703">So fossil fuels and collective
learning together</text><text start="909.736" dur="3.524">explain the staggering complexity
we see around us.</text><text start="916.505" dur="1">So --</text><text start="918.668" dur="1.317">Here we are,</text><text start="920.009" dur="1.524">back at the convention center.</text><text start="921.557" dur="4.706">We&amp;#39;ve been on a journey,
a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.</text><text start="926.967" dur="2.469">I hope you agree this is a powerful story.</text><text start="929.46" dur="4.665">And it&amp;#39;s a story in which humans
play an astonishing and creative role.</text><text start="934.466" dur="2.215">But it also contains warnings.</text><text start="937.474" dur="4.333">Collective learning is a very,
very powerful force,</text><text start="941.831" dur="4.405">and it&amp;#39;s not clear
that we humans are in charge of it.</text><text start="947.123" dur="3.069">I remember very vividly
as a child growing up in England,</text><text start="950.216" dur="2.02">living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.</text><text start="952.847" dur="3.611">For a few days, the entire biosphere</text><text start="956.482" dur="2.299">seemed to be on the verge of destruction.</text><text start="959.474" dur="3.165">And the same weapons are still here,</text><text start="962.663" dur="1.573">and they are still armed.</text><text start="965.004" dur="3.232">If we avoid that trap,
others are waiting for us.</text><text start="968.647" dur="2.589">We&amp;#39;re burning fossil fuels at such a rate</text><text start="971.26" dur="3.411">that we seem to be undermining
the Goldilocks conditions</text><text start="974.695" dur="2.228">that made it possible
for human civilizations</text><text start="976.947" dur="3.082">to flourish over the last 10,000 years.</text><text start="980.633" dur="2.276">So what big history can do</text><text start="982.933" dur="3.321">is show us the nature
of our complexity and fragility</text><text start="986.278" dur="1.924">and the dangers that face us,</text><text start="988.226" dur="3.58">but it can also show us
our power with collective learning.</text><text start="992.586" dur="1.952">And now, finally --</text><text start="995.657" dur="2.155">this is what I want.</text><text start="999.448" dur="3.032">I want my grandson, Daniel,</text><text start="1002.504" dur="2.757">and his friends and his generation,</text><text start="1005.285" dur="1.793">throughout the world,</text><text start="1007.102" dur="2.84">to know the story of big history,</text><text start="1009.966" dur="2.039">and to know it so well</text><text start="1012.029" dur="3.666">that they understand
both the challenges that face us</text><text start="1015.719" dur="2.517">and the opportunities that face us.</text><text start="1018.26" dur="1.88">And that&amp;#39;s why a group of us</text><text start="1020.164" dur="3.012">are building a free, online syllabus</text><text start="1023.2" dur="1.318">in big history</text><text start="1024.542" dur="2.151">for high-school students
throughout the world.</text><text start="1027.225" dur="2.436">We believe that big history</text><text start="1029.685" dur="2.551">will be a vital
intellectual tool for them,</text><text start="1032.26" dur="2.843">as Daniel and his generation</text><text start="1035.127" dur="2.348">face the huge challenges</text><text start="1037.499" dur="2.055">and also the huge opportunities</text><text start="1039.578" dur="3.455">ahead of them at this threshold moment</text><text start="1043.057" dur="3.179">in the history of our beautiful planet.</text><text start="1046.993" dur="1.548">I thank you for your attention.</text><text start="1048.565" dur="4.695">(Applause)</text></transcript>
