Reviewer: Morton Bast</text><text start="16.207" dur="3.371">The story starts:
I was at a friend&amp;#39;s house,</text><text start="19.602" dur="4.038">and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,</text><text start="23.664" dur="2.212">which is the manual of mental disorders.</text><text start="25.9" dur="3.27">It lists every known mental disorder.</text><text start="29.194" dur="3.033">And it used to be, back in the &amp;#39;50s,
a very slim pamphlet.</text><text start="32.251" dur="2.625">And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,</text><text start="34.9" dur="3.082">and now it&amp;#39;s 886 pages long.</text><text start="38.006" dur="4.344">And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.</text><text start="42.708" dur="1.384">So I was leafing through it,</text><text start="44.116" dur="2.917">wondering if I had any mental disorders,</text><text start="47.057" dur="1.661">and it turns out I&amp;#39;ve got 12.</text><text start="48.742" dur="1.151">(Laughter)</text><text start="49.917" dur="2.698">I&amp;#39;ve got generalized anxiety disorder,</text><text start="52.639" dur="1.246">which is a given.</text><text start="53.909" dur="2.016">I&amp;#39;ve got nightmare disorder,</text><text start="55.949" dur="1.365">which is categorized</text><text start="57.338" dur="4.04">if you have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure,</text><text start="61.402" dur="3.675">and all my dreams involve people
chasing me down the street</text><text start="65.101" dur="1.624">going, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a failure!&amp;quot;</text><text start="66.749" dur="1.783">(Laughter)</text><text start="68.556" dur="3.102">I&amp;#39;ve got parent-child relational problems,</text><text start="71.682" dur="1.945">which I blame my parents for.</text><text start="73.651" dur="1.895">(Laughter)</text><text start="75.57" dur="2.358">I&amp;#39;m kidding. I&amp;#39;m not kidding.</text><text start="77.952" dur="1.15">I&amp;#39;m kidding.</text><text start="79.888" dur="1.236">And I&amp;#39;ve got malingering.</text><text start="81.148" dur="1.736">And I think it&amp;#39;s actually quite rare</text><text start="82.908" dur="3.016">to have both malingering
and generalized anxiety disorder,</text><text start="85.948" dur="2.711">because malingering tends
to make me feel very anxious.</text><text start="88.683" dur="1.988">Anyway, I was looking through this book,</text><text start="90.695" dur="2.601">wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,</text><text start="93.32" dur="3.533">or maybe it&amp;#39;s not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder</text><text start="96.877" dur="2.126">if you&amp;#39;re not a trained professional,</text><text start="99.027" dur="4.873">or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire</text><text start="103.924" dur="4.366">to label what&amp;#39;s essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.</text><text start="108.314" dur="3.778">I didn&amp;#39;t know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,</text><text start="112.116" dur="2.86">and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry</text><text start="115" dur="1.384">to get their view,</text><text start="116.408" dur="3.338">which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.</text><text start="119.77" dur="1.236">(Laughter)</text><text start="121.03" dur="4.498">It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists</text><text start="125.552" dur="4.268">who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.</text><text start="129.844" dur="1.989">They&amp;#39;re called the CCHR.</text><text start="131.857" dur="2.951">And I said to him, &amp;quot;Can you prove to me</text><text start="134.832" dur="3.477">that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
that can&amp;#39;t be trusted?&amp;quot;</text><text start="138.912" dur="2.187">And he said, &amp;quot;Yes,
we can prove it to you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="141.123" dur="1.413">And I said, &amp;quot;How?&amp;quot;</text><text start="142.56" dur="2.785">And he said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going
to introduce you to Tony.&amp;quot;</text><text start="146.353" dur="1.251">And I said, &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s Tony?&amp;quot;</text><text start="148.234" dur="3.309">And he said, &amp;quot;Tony&amp;#39;s in Broadmoor.&amp;quot;</text><text start="151.567" dur="2.31">Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.</text><text start="153.901" dur="4.634">It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.</text><text start="158.559" dur="2.436">It&amp;#39;s where they send the serial killers,</text><text start="161.019" dur="2.056">and the people who can&amp;#39;t help themselves.</text><text start="163.099" dur="3.157">And I said to Brian,
&amp;quot;Well, what did Tony do?&amp;quot;</text><text start="166.28" dur="2.449">And he said, &amp;quot;Hardly anything.</text><text start="169.428" dur="2.938">He beat someone up or something,</text><text start="172.39" dur="5.095">and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.</text><text start="177.509" dur="4.513">But he faked it too well,
and now he&amp;#39;s stuck in Broadmoor</text><text start="182.046" dur="2.461">and nobody will believe he&amp;#39;s sane.</text><text start="184.531" dur="3.737">Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?&amp;quot;</text><text start="188.292" dur="1.212">So I said, &amp;quot;Yes, please.&amp;quot;</text><text start="190.646" dur="1.524">So I got the train to Broadmoor.</text><text start="192.194" dur="4.095">I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,</text><text start="196.313" dur="2.382">which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,</text><text start="198.719" dur="2.253">they yawn uncontrollably.</text><text start="200.996" dur="1.276">And we got to Broadmoor.</text><text start="202.718" dur="4.453">And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate</text><text start="207.195" dur="3.497">into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.</text><text start="210.716" dur="3.438">It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.</text><text start="214.178" dur="3.911">It&amp;#39;s all peach and pine
and calming colors.</text><text start="218.113" dur="5.192">And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.</text><text start="224.327" dur="1.847">And the patients started drifting in.</text><text start="227.408" dur="3.581">And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,</text><text start="231.013" dur="1.659">and quite docile-looking.</text><text start="232.696" dur="2.739">And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,</text><text start="235.459" dur="1.91">&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re medicated,&amp;quot;</text><text start="237.393" dur="3.219">which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,</text><text start="240.636" dur="2.581">but I&amp;#39;m thinking
it&amp;#39;s probably a good idea.</text><text start="243.241" dur="1.596">(Laughter)</text><text start="245.356" dur="2.064">And then Brian said, &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s Tony.&amp;quot;</text><text start="248.419" dur="1.519">And a man was walking in.</text><text start="250.425" dur="3.104">And he wasn&amp;#39;t overweight,
he was in very good physical shape.</text><text start="253.553" dur="2.303">And he wasn&amp;#39;t wearing sweatpants,</text><text start="255.88" dur="2.39">he was wearing a pinstripe suit.</text><text start="258.294" dur="1.996">And he had his arm outstretched</text><text start="260.314" dur="2.06">like someone out of The Apprentice.</text><text start="262.398" dur="3.282">He looked like a man
who wanted to wear an outfit</text><text start="265.704" dur="3.771">that would convince me
that he was very sane.</text><text start="270.263" dur="1.151">And he sat down.</text><text start="271.438" dur="2.905">And I said, &amp;quot;So is it true
that you faked your way in here?&amp;quot;</text><text start="274.763" dur="3.444">And he said, &amp;quot;Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
I beat someone up when I was 17.</text><text start="278.231" dur="2.082">And I was in prison awaiting trial,</text><text start="280.337" dur="1.315">and my cellmate said to me,</text><text start="281.676" dur="1.484">&amp;#39;You know what you have to do?</text><text start="283.184" dur="1.375">Fake madness.</text><text start="285.172" dur="3.611">Tell them you&amp;#39;re mad, you&amp;#39;ll get
sent to some cushy hospital.</text><text start="288.807" dur="3.831">Nurses will bring you pizzas,
you&amp;#39;ll have your own PlayStation.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;</text><text start="292.662" dur="1.692">I said, &amp;quot;Well, how did you do it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="294.378" dur="2.743">He said, &amp;quot;Well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.</text><text start="297.145" dur="2.287">And I&amp;#39;d just seen a film called &amp;#39;Crash,&amp;#39;</text><text start="299.456" dur="4.103">in which people get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.</text><text start="303.583" dur="1.949">So I said to the psychiatrist,</text><text start="305.556" dur="3.765">&amp;#39;I get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;</text><text start="309.345" dur="1.425">And I said, &amp;quot;What else?&amp;quot;</text><text start="310.794" dur="2.653">He said, &amp;quot;Oh, yeah.
I told the psychiatrist</text><text start="313.471" dur="3.284">that I wanted to watch women as they died,</text><text start="316.779" dur="2.165">because it would make
me feel more normal.&amp;quot;</text><text start="318.968" dur="1.722">I said, &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;d you get that from?&amp;quot;</text><text start="320.714" dur="2.784">He said, &amp;quot;Oh, from a biography
of Ted Bundy that they had</text><text start="323.522" dur="1.193">at the prison library.&amp;quot;</text><text start="325.749" dur="3.227">Anyway, he faked madness
too well, he said.</text><text start="329" dur="2.47">And they didn&amp;#39;t send him
to some cushy hospital.</text><text start="331.494" dur="1.581">They sent him to Broadmoor.</text><text start="333.799" dur="1.337">And the minute he got there,</text><text start="335.16" dur="3.106">said he took one look at the place,
asked to see the psychiatrist,</text><text start="338.29" dur="2.518">said, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s been
a terrible misunderstanding.</text><text start="340.832" dur="1.409">I&amp;#39;m not mentally ill.&amp;quot;</text><text start="343.032" dur="2.266">I said, &amp;quot;How long have you been here for?&amp;quot;</text><text start="345.322" dur="2.346">He said, &amp;quot;Well, if I&amp;#39;d just
done my time in prison</text><text start="347.692" dur="2.703">for the original crime,
I&amp;#39;d have got five years.</text><text start="350.832" dur="2.455">I&amp;#39;ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years.&amp;quot;</text><text start="356.171" dur="4.029">Tony said that it&amp;#39;s a lot harder
to convince people you&amp;#39;re sane</text><text start="360.224" dur="2.484">than it is to convince them you&amp;#39;re crazy.</text><text start="362.732" dur="2.223">He said, &amp;quot;I thought
the best way to seem normal</text><text start="364.979" dur="2.62">would be to talk to people
normally about normal things</text><text start="367.623" dur="1.878">like football or what&amp;#39;s on TV.</text><text start="369.525" dur="1.738">I subscribe to New Scientist,</text><text start="371.287" dur="1.667">and recently they had an article</text><text start="372.978" dur="4.36">about how the U.S. Army was training
bumblebees to sniff out explosives.</text><text start="377.362" dur="1.419">So I said to a nurse,</text><text start="378.805" dur="2.599">&amp;#39;Did you know that the U.S. Army
is training bumblebees</text><text start="381.428" dur="1.328">to sniff out explosives?&amp;#39;</text><text start="383.847" dur="2.455">When I read my medical notes,
I saw they&amp;#39;d written:</text><text start="386.646" dur="3.012">&amp;#39;Believes bees can sniff out explosives.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;</text><text start="389.682" dur="1.554">(Laughter)</text><text start="391.26" dur="3.107">He said, &amp;quot;You know, they&amp;#39;re always
looking out for nonverbal clues</text><text start="394.391" dur="1.74">to my mental state.</text><text start="396.155" dur="2.637">But how do you sit in a sane way?</text><text start="398.816" dur="2.272">How do you cross your legs in a sane way?</text><text start="401.112" dur="1.508">It&amp;#39;s just impossible.&amp;quot;</text><text start="402.936" dur="1.257">When Tony said that to me,</text><text start="404.217" dur="3.509">I thought to myself,
&amp;quot;Am I sitting like a journalist?</text><text start="408.107" dur="2.309">Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?&amp;quot;</text><text start="411.332" dur="5.072">He said, &amp;quot;You know, I&amp;#39;ve got
the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,</text><text start="416.428" dur="2.389">and I&amp;#39;ve got the &amp;#39;Tiptoe
Through the Tulips&amp;#39; rapist</text><text start="418.841" dur="1.367">on the other side of me.</text><text start="420.232" dur="3.449">So I tend to stay in my room a lot
because I find them quite frightening.</text><text start="423.705" dur="2.261">And they take that as a sign of madness.</text><text start="425.99" dur="3.515">They say it proves
that I&amp;#39;m aloof and grandiose.&amp;quot;</text><text start="429.953" dur="3.796">So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
to hang out with serial killers</text><text start="433.773" dur="1.587">be a sign of madness.</text><text start="435.384" dur="3.076">Anyway, he seemed completely normal
to me, but what did I know?</text><text start="439.174" dur="2.82">And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.</text><text start="442.018" dur="1.574">I said, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the story?&amp;quot;</text><text start="443.616" dur="3.511">And he said, &amp;quot;Yep.
We accept that Tony faked madness</text><text start="447.151" dur="3.766">to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations --</text><text start="450.941" dur="2.151">that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with --</text><text start="453.116" dur="2.618">just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.</text><text start="455.758" dur="2.205">However, we have assessed him,</text><text start="457.987" dur="2.413">and we&amp;#39;ve determined that what he is</text><text start="460.424" dur="1.388">is a psychopath.&amp;quot;</text><text start="462.243" dur="1.808">And in fact, faking madness</text><text start="464.075" dur="4.366">is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.</text><text start="468.465" dur="2.418">It&amp;#39;s on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.</text><text start="471.41" dur="1.577">So, faking your brain going wrong</text><text start="473.011" dur="3.232">is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.</text><text start="476.267" dur="1.572">And I spoke to other experts,</text><text start="477.863" dur="3.939">and they said the pinstripe
suit -- classic psychopath --</text><text start="481.826" dur="2.278">speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:</text><text start="484.128" dur="3.344">glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.</text><text start="487.969" dur="3.612">And I said, &amp;quot;Well, but why didn&amp;#39;t
he hang out with the other patients?&amp;quot;</text><text start="491.605" dur="3.93">Classic psychopath -- it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.</text><text start="495.978" dur="3.464">So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony</text><text start="499.466" dur="3.025">was evidence, according to his clinician,</text><text start="502.515" dur="1.824">that he was mad in this new way.</text><text start="504.69" dur="1.403">He was a psychopath.</text><text start="506.117" dur="3.525">And his clinician said to me, &amp;quot;If you
want to know more about psychopaths,</text><text start="509.666" dur="3.205">you can go on a psychopath-spotting course</text><text start="512.895" dur="2.887">run by Robert Hare, who invented
the psychopath checklist.&amp;quot;</text><text start="515.806" dur="1.16">So I did.</text><text start="516.99" dur="2.043">I went on a psychopath-spotting course,</text><text start="519.057" dur="4.177">and I am now a certified --</text><text start="523.258" dur="4.259">and I have to say, extremely adept --
psychopath spotter.</text><text start="528.194" dur="3.245">So, here&amp;#39;s the statistics:</text><text start="531.463" dur="4.122">One in a hundred regular people
is a psychopath.</text><text start="536.255" dur="3.833">So there&amp;#39;s 1,500 people in his room.</text><text start="540.112" dur="3.043">Fifteen of you are psychopaths.</text><text start="545.091" dur="4.982">Although that figure rises to four percent
of CEOs and business leaders,</text><text start="550.097" dur="2.735">so I think there&amp;#39;s a very good chance</text><text start="552.856" dur="5.114">there&amp;#39;s about 30 or 40
psychopaths in this room.</text><text start="557.994" dur="2.434">It could be carnage
by the end of the night.</text><text start="560.452" dur="4.456">(Laughter)</text><text start="564.932" dur="4.896">Hare said the reason why
is because capitalism at its most ruthless</text><text start="569.852" dur="2.644">rewards psychopathic behavior --</text><text start="572.52" dur="4.937">the lack of empathy, the glibness,</text><text start="577.481" dur="2.358">cunning, manipulative.</text><text start="579.863" dur="2.965">In fact, capitalism, perhaps
at its most remorseless,</text><text start="582.852" dur="3.779">is a physical manifestation
of psychopathy.</text><text start="587.377" dur="4.853">It&amp;#39;s like a form of psychopathy
that&amp;#39;s come down to affect us all.</text><text start="592.567" dur="2.871">Hare said, &amp;quot;You know what?
Forget about some guy at Broadmoor</text><text start="595.462" dur="1.815">who may or may not have faked madness.</text><text start="597.301" dur="1.621">Who cares? That&amp;#39;s not a big story.</text><text start="598.946" dur="2.893">The big story,&amp;quot; he said,
&amp;quot;is corporate psychopathy.</text><text start="601.863" dur="3.831">You want to go and interview yourself
some corporate psychopaths.&amp;quot;</text><text start="606.216" dur="3.183">So I gave it a try.
I wrote to the Enron people.</text><text start="609.423" dur="2.346">I said, &amp;quot;Could I come
and interview you in prison,</text><text start="611.793" dur="1.77">to find out it you&amp;#39;re psychopaths?&amp;quot;</text><text start="613.587" dur="1.23">(Laughter)</text><text start="614.841" dur="1.276">And they didn&amp;#39;t reply.</text><text start="616.141" dur="1.55">(Laughter)</text><text start="617.715" dur="1.897">So I changed tack.</text><text start="619.636" dur="3.276">I emailed &amp;quot;Chainsaw Al&amp;quot; Dunlap,</text><text start="622.936" dur="3.539">the asset stripper from the 1990s.</text><text start="626.499" dur="2.207">He would come into failing businesses</text><text start="628.73" dur="2.035">and close down 30 percent
of the workforce,</text><text start="630.789" dur="3.144">just turn American towns into ghost towns.</text><text start="633.957" dur="1.453">And I emailed him and I said,</text><text start="635.434" dur="2.794">&amp;quot;I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly</text><text start="638.252" dur="2.011">that makes you ... special,</text><text start="640.287" dur="4.361">and interested in the predatory
spirit, and fearless.</text><text start="644.672" dur="3.452">Can I come and interview you
about your special brain anomaly?&amp;quot;</text><text start="648.148" dur="1.818">And he said, &amp;quot;Come on over!&amp;quot;</text><text start="649.99" dur="1.361">(Laughter)</text><text start="651.375" dur="3.052">So I went to Al Dunlap&amp;#39;s
grand Florida mansion.</text><text start="654.451" dur="4.708">It was filled with sculptures
of predatory animals.</text><text start="659.522" dur="3.639">There were lions and tigers --
he was taking me through the garden --</text><text start="663.185" dur="2.692">there were falcons and eagles,</text><text start="665.901" dur="2.504">he was saying, &amp;quot;Over there
you&amp;#39;ve got sharks and --&amp;quot;</text><text start="668.429" dur="2.213">he was saying this
in a less effeminate way --</text><text start="670.666" dur="4.202">&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got more sharks
and you&amp;#39;ve got tigers.&amp;quot;</text><text start="676.366" dur="1.7">It was like Narnia.</text><text start="678.09" dur="3.478">(Laughter)</text><text start="681.592" dur="1.646">And then we went into his kitchen.</text><text start="684.032" dur="4.152">Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
to save failing companies,</text><text start="688.208" dur="2.423">he&amp;#39;d close down 30 percent
of the workforce.</text><text start="690.655" dur="3.179">And he&amp;#39;d quite often
fire people with a joke.</text><text start="693.858" dur="2.345">Like, for instance,
one famous story about him,</text><text start="696.227" dur="3.452">somebody came up to him and said,
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve just bought myself a new car.&amp;quot;</text><text start="699.703" dur="2.008">And he said, &amp;quot;Well,
you may have a new car,</text><text start="701.735" dur="3.505">but I&amp;#39;ll tell you what you
don&amp;#39;t have -- a job.&amp;quot;</text><text start="706.802" dur="1.156">So in his kitchen --</text><text start="707.982" dur="2.958">he was in there with his wife, Judy,
and his bodyguard, Sean --</text><text start="710.964" dur="2.056">and I said, &amp;quot;You know
how I said in my email</text><text start="713.044" dur="3.636">that you might have a special brain
anomaly that makes you special?&amp;quot;</text><text start="716.704" dur="2.902">He said, &amp;quot;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s an amazing
theory, it&amp;#39;s like Star Trek.</text><text start="719.63" dur="2.212">You&amp;#39;re going where
no man has gone before.&amp;quot;</text><text start="721.866" dur="3.104">And I said, &amp;quot;Well --&amp;quot; (Clears throat)</text><text start="724.994" dur="1.329">(Laughter)</text><text start="726.347" dur="3.163">Some psychologists might say</text><text start="729.534" dur="2.678">that this makes you --&amp;quot;
(Mumbles)</text><text start="732.236" dur="1.627">(Laughter)</text><text start="733.887" dur="1.474">And he said, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;</text><text start="736.101" dur="1.304">And I said, &amp;quot;A psychopath.&amp;quot;</text><text start="737.429" dur="4.379">And I said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got a list
of psychopathic traits in my pocket.</text><text start="741.832" dur="2.159">Can I go through them with you?&amp;quot;</text><text start="744.653" dur="2.093">And he looked intrigued despite himself,</text><text start="746.77" dur="1.375">and he said, &amp;quot;Okay, go on.&amp;quot;</text><text start="748.169" dur="3.383">And I said, &amp;quot;Okay.
Grandiose sense of self-worth.&amp;quot;</text><text start="751.576" dur="2.776">Which I have to say, would
have been hard for him to deny,</text><text start="754.376" dur="3.384">because he was standing
under a giant oil painting of himself.</text><text start="757.784" dur="4.151">(Laughter)</text><text start="761.959" dur="3.033">He said, &amp;quot;Well, you&amp;#39;ve
got to believe in you!&amp;quot;</text><text start="765.016" dur="2.888">And I said, &amp;quot;Manipulative.&amp;quot;</text><text start="767.928" dur="1.693">He said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s leadership.&amp;quot;</text><text start="769.645" dur="1.001">(Laughter)</text><text start="770.67" dur="2.406">And I said, &amp;quot;Shallow affect,</text><text start="773.1" dur="2.272">an inability to experience
a range of emotions.&amp;quot;</text><text start="775.396" dur="3.606">He said, &amp;quot;Who wants to be weighed
down by some nonsense emotions?&amp;quot;</text><text start="779.026" dur="2.171">So he was going down
the psychopath checklist,</text><text start="781.221" dur="3.201">basically turning it
into &amp;quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&amp;quot;</text><text start="784.446" dur="3.092">(Laughter)</text><text start="787.562" dur="3.42">But I did notice something happening
to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.</text><text start="791.006" dur="2.897">Whenever he said anything to me
that was kind of normal --</text><text start="793.927" dur="2.943">like he said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to juvenile delinquency,</text><text start="796.894" dur="1.906">he said he got accepted into West Point,</text><text start="798.824" dur="2.855">and they don&amp;#39;t let
delinquents in West Point.</text><text start="801.703" dur="2.716">He said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to many short-term
marital relationships.</text><text start="804.443" dur="1.66">He&amp;#39;s only ever been married twice.</text><text start="806.127" dur="2.947">Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers</text><text start="809.098" dur="2.44">that he once threatened her with a knife</text><text start="811.562" dur="2.717">and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,</text><text start="814.303" dur="2.042">but people say stupid things to each other</text><text start="816.369" dur="2.055">in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,</text><text start="818.448" dur="3.021">and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.</text><text start="821.493" dur="3.698">So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,</text><text start="825.215" dur="3.143">I thought to myself, well I&amp;#39;m not
going to put that in my book.</text><text start="828.868" dur="3.304">And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter</text><text start="832.196" dur="3.476">had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.</text><text start="835.696" dur="4.944">Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked &amp;quot;Psychopath.&amp;quot;</text><text start="840.664" dur="4.71">I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.</text><text start="845.398" dur="1.202">And I realized, my God --</text><text start="846.624" dur="2.003">this is what I&amp;#39;ve been doing for 20 years.</text><text start="848.651" dur="1.622">It&amp;#39;s what all journalists do.</text><text start="850.297" dur="3.46">We travel across the world
with our notepads in our hands,</text><text start="853.781" dur="1.795">and we wait for the gems.</text><text start="856.242" dur="4.333">And the gems are always
the outermost aspects</text><text start="860.599" dur="1.629">of our interviewee&amp;#39;s personality.</text><text start="862.252" dur="3.474">And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,</text><text start="865.75" dur="3.527">and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.</text><text start="870.187" dur="3.019">And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses</text><text start="873.23" dur="3.277">certain mental disorders hugely.</text><text start="876.531" dur="1.342">Childhood bipolar --</text><text start="877.897" dur="3.555">children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar</text><text start="881.476" dur="2.43">because they have temper tantrums,</text><text start="883.93" dur="3.714">which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.</text><text start="888.533" dur="2.963">When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.</text><text start="892.697" dur="2.773">He said, &amp;quot;Why haven&amp;#39;t you
been returning my calls?&amp;quot;</text><text start="895.494" dur="3.349">I said, &amp;quot;Well, they say
that you&amp;#39;re a psychopath.&amp;quot;</text><text start="898.867" dur="1.954">And he said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not a psychopath.&amp;quot;</text><text start="900.845" dur="1.159">He said, &amp;quot;You know what?</text><text start="902.028" dur="2.672">One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,</text><text start="904.724" dur="2.861">but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.</text><text start="907.609" dur="2.366">So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,</text><text start="909.999" dur="1.74">they say, &amp;#39;Typical of the psychopath</text><text start="911.763" dur="3.377">to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn&amp;#39;t.&amp;#39;</text><text start="915.164" dur="3.068">It&amp;#39;s like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down.&amp;quot;</text><text start="919.581" dur="2.235">He said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got a tribunal coming up.</text><text start="921.84" dur="1.24">Will you come to it?&amp;quot;</text><text start="924" dur="1.157">So I said okay.</text><text start="925.783" dur="1.484">So I went to his tribunal.</text><text start="928.195" dur="3.848">And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.</text><text start="933.101" dur="2.805">They decided that he shouldn&amp;#39;t
be held indefinitely</text><text start="935.93" dur="3.69">because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean</text><text start="939.644" dur="4.531">that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.</text><text start="944.9" dur="1.49">So they let him go.</text><text start="946.414" dur="2.021">And outside in the corridor he said to me,</text><text start="948.459" dur="1.155">&amp;quot;You know what, Jon?</text><text start="950.101" dur="1.963">Everyone&amp;#39;s a bit psychopathic.&amp;quot;</text><text start="952.88" dur="3.267">He said, &amp;quot;You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am.&amp;quot;</text><text start="957.276" dur="2.012">I said, &amp;quot;What are you going to do now?&amp;quot;</text><text start="959.312" dur="2.183">He said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to go to Belgium.</text><text start="961.519" dur="1.678">There&amp;#39;s a woman there that I fancy.</text><text start="963.221" dur="3.955">But she&amp;#39;s married, so I&amp;#39;m going to have
to get her split up from her husband.&amp;quot;</text><text start="967.2" dur="3.757">(Laughter)</text><text start="971.335" dur="3.033">Anyway, that was two years ago,</text><text start="974.392" dur="1.578">and that&amp;#39;s where my book ended.</text><text start="975.994" dur="4.562">And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.</text><text start="981.26" dur="1.361">Nothing bad happened.</text><text start="982.645" dur="2.139">He was living with a girl outside London.</text><text start="984.808" dur="2.098">He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,</text><text start="986.93" dur="3.026">making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,</text><text start="989.98" dur="1.556">but isn&amp;#39;t necessarily ominous.</text><text start="992.222" dur="1.897">Unfortunately, after 20 months,</text><text start="994.143" dur="2.71">he did go back to jail for a month.</text><text start="996.877" dur="4.156">He got into a &amp;quot;fracas&amp;quot;
in a bar, he called it.</text><text start="1001.364" dur="2.641">Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,</text><text start="1004.029" dur="3.888">but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,</text><text start="1007.941" dur="1.605">it wasn&amp;#39;t too bad.</text><text start="1010.329" dur="1.561">And then he phoned me.</text><text start="1013.062" dur="4.236">And you know what, I think
it&amp;#39;s right that Tony is out.</text><text start="1018.158" dur="3.155">Because you shouldn&amp;#39;t define
people by their maddest edges.</text><text start="1021.337" dur="3.836">And what Tony is,
is he&amp;#39;s a semi-psychopath.</text><text start="1025.592" dur="4.73">He&amp;#39;s a gray area in a world
that doesn&amp;#39;t like gray areas.</text><text start="1031.056" dur="3.997">But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.</text><text start="1036.052" dur="2.421">It&amp;#39;s where you find the humanity,</text><text start="1038.497" dur="1.874">and it&amp;#39;s where you find the truth.</text><text start="1041.381" dur="2.108">And Tony said to me,</text><text start="1043.513" dur="3.872">&amp;quot;Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?</text><text start="1047.409" dur="3.3">I just want to thank you
for everything you&amp;#39;ve done for me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1050.733" dur="1.291">And I didn&amp;#39;t go.</text><text start="1052.934" dur="1.82">What would you have done?</text><text start="1055.761" dur="1.352">Thank you.</text><text start="1057.137" dur="6.647">(Applause)</text></transcript>
