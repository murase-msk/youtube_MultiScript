<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="15.728" dur="4.603">As a magician, I try to create images
that make people stop and think.</text><text start="21.26" dur="1.976">I also try to challenge myself</text><text start="23.26" dur="3.976">to do things that doctors
say are not possible.</text><text start="27.862" dur="4.374">I was buried alive
in New York City in a coffin,</text><text start="32.26" dur="4.853">buried alive in a coffin
in April, 1999, for a week.</text><text start="37.883" dur="2.5">I lived there with nothing but water.</text><text start="41.422" dur="2.814">And it ended up being so much fun</text><text start="44.26" dur="3.976">that I decided I could pursue
doing more of these things.</text><text start="48.26" dur="3.432">The next one is I froze myself
in a block of ice</text><text start="51.716" dur="2.52">for three days and three nights
in New York City.</text><text start="54.26" dur="3.697">That one was way more difficult
than I had expected.</text><text start="59.26" dur="2.976">The one after that, I stood
on top of a hundred-foot pillar</text><text start="62.26" dur="1.976">for 36 hours.</text><text start="64.26" dur="2.499">I began to hallucinate so hard</text><text start="66.783" dur="3.703">that the buildings that were behind me
started to look like big animal heads.</text><text start="71.462" dur="1.774">So, next I went to London.</text><text start="73.26" dur="3.976">In London I lived
in a glass box for 44 days</text><text start="77.26" dur="1.976">with nothing but water.</text><text start="79.26" dur="3">It was, for me, one of the most difficult
things I&amp;#39;d ever done,</text><text start="82.284" dur="3.083">but it was also the most beautiful.</text><text start="86.26" dur="2.976">There was so many skeptics,
especially the press in London,</text><text start="89.26" dur="5.976">that they started flying cheeseburgers
on helicopters around my box to tempt me.</text><text start="95.26" dur="1.031">(Laughter)</text><text start="96.315" dur="2.921">So, I felt very validated</text><text start="99.26" dur="4.979">when the New England Journal of Medicine
actually used the research for science.</text><text start="105.68" dur="3.556">My next pursuit was I wanted to see
how long I could go without breathing,</text><text start="109.26" dur="3.417">like how long I could survive
with nothing, not even air.</text><text start="113.65" dur="3.834">I didn&amp;#39;t realize that it would become
the most amazing journey of my life.</text><text start="120.26" dur="1.976">As a young magician,</text><text start="122.26" dur="3.976">I was obsessed with Houdini
and his underwater challenges.</text><text start="126.26" dur="2.976">So, I began, early on,
competing against the other kids,</text><text start="129.26" dur="3.976">seeing how long I could stay underwater
while they went up and down to breathe,</text><text start="133.26" dur="2.976">you know, five times,
while I stayed under on one breath.</text><text start="136.26" dur="1.976">By the time I was a teenager,</text><text start="138.26" dur="2.976">I was able to hold my breath
for three minutes and 30 seconds.</text><text start="141.968" dur="3.151">I would later find out
that was Houdini&amp;#39;s personal record.</text><text start="147.26" dur="2.976">In 1987 I heard of a story</text><text start="150.26" dur="4.976">about a boy that fell through ice
and was trapped under a river.</text><text start="156.09" dur="5.146">He was underneath,
not breathing for 45 minutes.</text><text start="161.26" dur="1.976">When the rescue workers came,</text><text start="163.26" dur="2.976">they resuscitated him
and there was no brain damage.</text><text start="166.26" dur="4.303">His core temperature
had dropped to 77 degrees.</text><text start="171.486" dur="2.75">As a magician,
I think everything is possible.</text><text start="174.26" dur="2.191">And I think if something
is done by one person,</text><text start="176.475" dur="2.489">it can be done by others.</text><text start="178.988" dur="1.382">I started to think,</text><text start="180.394" dur="3.708">if the boy could survive
without breathing for that long,</text><text start="184.126" dur="1.864">there must be a way that I could do it.</text><text start="186.85" dur="2.386">So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.</text><text start="189.26" dur="3.214">And I asked him, how long
is it possible to go without breathing,</text><text start="192.498" dur="2.38">like how long could I go without air?</text><text start="194.902" dur="2.334">And he said to me that anything
over six minutes</text><text start="197.26" dur="4.21">you have a serious risk
of hypoxic brain damage.</text><text start="203.319" dur="2.791">So, I took that as a challenge, basically.</text><text start="206.134" dur="1.102">(Laughter)</text><text start="207.26" dur="6.527">My first try, I figured
that I could do something similar,</text><text start="213.855" dur="2.381">and I created a water tank,</text><text start="216.26" dur="3.544">and I filled it with ice
and freezing cold water.</text><text start="219.828" dur="2.408">And I stayed inside of that water tank</text><text start="222.26" dur="2.976">hoping my core temperature
would start to drop.</text><text start="225.26" dur="1.403">And I was shivering.</text><text start="226.687" dur="3.493">In my first attempt to hold my breath,
I couldn&amp;#39;t even last a minute.</text><text start="230.204" dur="2.514">So, I realized that was completely
not going to work.</text><text start="233.983" dur="2.197">I went to talk to a doctor friend --</text><text start="238.919" dur="4.317">and I asked him, &amp;quot;How could I do that?&amp;quot;</text><text start="243.26" dur="3.429">&amp;quot;I want to hold my breath for a really
long time. How could it be done?&amp;quot;</text><text start="246.713" dur="2.523">And he said, &amp;quot;David, you&amp;#39;re a magician,</text><text start="249.26" dur="2.976">create the illusion of not breathing,
it will be much easier.&amp;quot;</text><text start="252.26" dur="2.653">(Laughter)</text><text start="256.073" dur="4.163">So, he came up with this idea
of creating a rebreather,</text><text start="260.26" dur="2.621">with a CO2 scrubber,</text><text start="262.905" dur="4.331">which was basically
a tube from Home Depot,</text><text start="267.26" dur="2.976">with a balloon duct-taped to it,</text><text start="270.26" dur="2.976">that he thought we could put inside of me,</text><text start="273.26" dur="3.976">and somehow be able to circulate
the air and rebreathe</text><text start="277.26" dur="1.566">with this thing in me.</text><text start="279.778" dur="3.458">This is a little hard to watch.</text><text start="283.26" dur="2.027">But this is that attempt.</text><text start="292.26" dur="1.976">So, that clearly wasn&amp;#39;t going to work.</text><text start="294.26" dur="3.144">(Laughter)</text><text start="298.26" dur="3.976">Then I actually started thinking
about liquid breathing.</text><text start="302.26" dur="2.976">There is a chemical
that&amp;#39;s called perflubron.</text><text start="305.26" dur="3.976">And it&amp;#39;s so high in oxygen levels
that in theory you could breathe it.</text><text start="309.26" dur="2.976">So, I got my hands on that chemical,</text><text start="312.26" dur="2.976">filled the sink up with it,
and stuck my face in the sink</text><text start="315.26" dur="3.976">and tried to breathe that in,
which was really impossible.</text><text start="319.26" dur="2.976">It&amp;#39;s basically like trying
to breathe, as a doctor said,</text><text start="322.26" dur="2.286">while having an elephant
standing on your chest.</text><text start="324.57" dur="2.133">So, that idea disappeared.</text><text start="326.727" dur="2.246">Then I started thinking,</text><text start="328.997" dur="4.239">would it be possible to hook up
a heart/lung bypass machine</text><text start="333.26" dur="2.976">and have a surgery where it was
a tube going into my artery,</text><text start="336.26" dur="3.503">and then appear to not breathe
while they were oxygenating my blood?</text><text start="340.582" dur="3.189">Which was another insane idea, obviously.</text><text start="344.89" dur="3.509">Then I thought about
the craziest idea of all the ideas:</text><text start="349.787" dur="1.449">to actually do it.</text><text start="351.26" dur="1.047">(Laughter)</text><text start="352.331" dur="3.412">To actually try to hold
my breath past the point</text><text start="355.767" dur="2.931">that doctors would
consider you brain dead.</text><text start="361.028" dur="4.208">So, I started researching
into pearl divers.</text><text start="365.26" dur="2.976">You know, because they go down
for four minutes on one breath.</text><text start="368.26" dur="3.576">And when I was researching pearl divers,
I found the world of free-diving.</text><text start="372.788" dur="3.952">It was the most amazing thing
that I ever discovered, pretty much.</text><text start="377.856" dur="2.38">There is many different
aspects to free-diving.</text><text start="380.26" dur="3.524">There is depth records,
where people go as deep as they can.</text><text start="383.808" dur="1.9">And then there is static apnea.</text><text start="385.732" dur="2.504">That&amp;#39;s holding your breath
as long as you can</text><text start="388.26" dur="1.976">in one place without moving.</text><text start="390.26" dur="1.976">That was the one that I studied.</text><text start="392.26" dur="3.096">The first thing that I learned
is when you&amp;#39;re holding your breath,</text><text start="395.38" dur="2.856">you should never move at all;
that wastes energy.</text><text start="398.26" dur="2.639">And that depletes oxygen,</text><text start="400.923" dur="1.839">and it builds up CO2 in your blood.</text><text start="402.786" dur="1.868">So, I learned never to move.</text><text start="404.678" dur="2.558">And I learned how to slow
my heart rate down.</text><text start="407.26" dur="2.191">I had to remain
perfectly still and just relax</text><text start="409.475" dur="3.761">and think that I wasn&amp;#39;t in my body,
and just control that.</text><text start="413.26" dur="1.976">And then I learned how to purge.</text><text start="415.26" dur="2.453">Purging is basically hyperventilating.</text><text start="417.737" dur="1.192">You blow in and out --</text><text start="418.953" dur="4.283">(Breathing loudly)</text><text start="423.26" dur="2.977">You do that, you get lightheaded,
you get tingling.</text><text start="426.261" dur="2.305">And you&amp;#39;re really ridding
your body of CO2.</text><text start="428.59" dur="3.253">So, when you hold your breath,
it&amp;#39;s infinitely easier.</text><text start="432.676" dur="3.603">Then I learned that you have
to take a huge breath,</text><text start="436.412" dur="3.824">and just hold and relax
and never let any air out,</text><text start="440.26" dur="2.495">and just hold and relax
through all the pain.</text><text start="443.26" dur="2.565">Every morning, this is for months,</text><text start="445.849" dur="2.84">I would wake up
and the first thing that I would do</text><text start="448.713" dur="2.333">is I would hold my breath</text><text start="451.086" dur="5.15">for, out of 52 minutes,
I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.</text><text start="456.26" dur="2.191">So, basically what that means
is I would purge,</text><text start="458.475" dur="1.861">I&amp;#39;d breathe really hard for a minute.</text><text start="460.36" dur="3.269">And I would hold, immediately after,
for five and a half minutes.</text><text start="463.653" dur="3.583">Then I would breathe again for a minute,
purging as hard as I can,</text><text start="467.26" dur="3.577">then immediately after that I would hold
again for five and a half minutes.</text><text start="470.861" dur="2.911">I would repeat this process
eight times in a row.</text><text start="473.796" dur="3.44">Out of 52 minutes, you&amp;#39;re only
breathing for eight minutes.</text><text start="477.26" dur="2.976">At the end of that
you&amp;#39;re completely fried, your brain.</text><text start="480.26" dur="2.191">You feel like you&amp;#39;re walking
around in a daze.</text><text start="482.475" dur="1.761">And you have these awful headaches.</text><text start="484.26" dur="3.976">Basically, I&amp;#39;m not the best person
to talk to when I&amp;#39;m doing that stuff.</text><text start="488.26" dur="2.334">I started learning
about the world-record holder.</text><text start="490.618" dur="1.618">His name is Tom Sietas.</text><text start="492.26" dur="3.976">And this guy is perfectly built
for holding his breath.</text><text start="496.26" dur="3.976">He&amp;#39;s six foot four. He&amp;#39;s 160 pounds.</text><text start="500.26" dur="4.976">And his total lung capacity
is twice the size of an average person.</text><text start="505.26" dur="2.487">I&amp;#39;m six foot one, and fat.</text><text start="508.837" dur="1.399">We&amp;#39;ll say big-boned.</text><text start="510.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="512.26" dur="3.976">I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.</text><text start="516.26" dur="4.51">So, everything that I put into my body,
I considered as medicine.</text><text start="520.794" dur="4.442">Every bit of food was exactly
what it was for its nutritional value.</text><text start="525.26" dur="3.976">I ate really small controlled portions
throughout the day.</text><text start="529.26" dur="4.197">And I started to really adapt my body.</text><text start="533.481" dur="2.142">[Individual results may vary]</text><text start="535.647" dur="2.589">(Laughter)</text><text start="538.26" dur="3.625">The thinner I was, the longer
I was able to hold my breath.</text><text start="541.909" dur="3.327">And by eating so well
and training so hard,</text><text start="545.26" dur="3.5">my resting heart-rate dropped
to 38 beats per minute.</text><text start="548.784" dur="2.204">Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.</text><text start="552.301" dur="1.55">In four months of training,</text><text start="553.875" dur="2.473">I was able to hold my breath
for over seven minutes.</text><text start="557.58" dur="2.656">I wanted to try holding
my breath everywhere.</text><text start="560.26" dur="2.334">I wanted to try it
in the most extreme situations</text><text start="562.618" dur="4.295">to see if I could slow
my heart rate down under duress.</text><text start="566.937" dur="2.443">(Laughter)</text><text start="570.26" dur="2.976">I decided that I was going
to break the world record</text><text start="573.26" dur="2.577">live on prime-time television.</text><text start="575.861" dur="3.375">The world record was
eight minutes and 58 seconds,</text><text start="579.26" dur="3.191">held by Tom Sietas, that guy
with the whale lungs I told you about.</text><text start="584.26" dur="3.413">I assumed that I could put
a water tank at Lincoln Center</text><text start="587.697" dur="3.539">and if I stayed there a week not eating,</text><text start="591.26" dur="3.976">I would get comfortable in that situation
and I would slow my metabolism,</text><text start="595.26" dur="2.143">which I was sure would help me
hold my breath</text><text start="597.427" dur="1.769">longer than I had been able to do it.</text><text start="600.022" dur="1.532">I was completely wrong.</text><text start="602.696" dur="3.946">I entered the sphere a week
before the scheduled air date.</text><text start="606.667" dur="2.722">And I thought everything
seemed to be on track.</text><text start="610.26" dur="3.976">Two days before my big
breath-hold attempt, for the record,</text><text start="614.26" dur="1.976">the producers of my television special</text><text start="616.26" dur="5.866">thought that just watching somebody
holding their breath, and almost drowning,</text><text start="622.15" dur="2.086">is too boring for television.</text><text start="624.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="626.26" dur="5.384">So, I had to add handcuffs,
while holding my breath, to escape from.</text><text start="631.668" dur="1.824">This was a critical mistake.</text><text start="634.668" dur="3.568">Because of the movement,
I was wasting oxygen.</text><text start="638.26" dur="4.242">And by seven minutes I had gone
into these awful convulsions.</text><text start="644.26" dur="3.734">By 7:08, I started to black out.</text><text start="649.26" dur="2.976">And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,</text><text start="652.26" dur="2.432">they had to pull my body out
and bring me back.</text><text start="660.26" dur="1.976">I had failed on every level.</text><text start="662.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="664.26" dur="5.878">So, naturally, the only way out
of the slump that I could think of was,</text><text start="670.219" dur="2.463">I decided to call Oprah.</text><text start="672.706" dur="3.437">(Laughter)</text><text start="676.26" dur="1.976">I told her that I wanted to up the ante</text><text start="678.26" dur="3.976">and hold my breath longer
than any human being ever had.</text><text start="682.26" dur="1.758">This was a different record.</text><text start="684.042" dur="2.51">This was a pure O2 static apnea record</text><text start="686.576" dur="3.405">that Guinness had set
the world record at 13 minutes.</text><text start="691.528" dur="5.543">So, basically you breathe pure O2 first,
oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,</text><text start="697.095" dur="2.063">and you are able to hold much longer.</text><text start="700.818" dur="4.426">I realized that my real competition
was the beaver.</text><text start="705.268" dur="2.746">(Laughter)</text><text start="711.235" dur="1.001">(Laughter ends)</text><text start="712.26" dur="1.976">In January of &amp;#39;08,</text><text start="714.26" dur="2.617">Oprah gave me four months
to prepare and train.</text><text start="717.925" dur="2.968">So, I would sleep
in a hypoxic tent every night.</text><text start="720.917" dur="4.319">A hypoxic tent is a tent
that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.</text><text start="725.26" dur="2.673">So, it&amp;#39;s like base camp, Everest.</text><text start="727.957" dur="5.279">What that does is, you start building up
the red bloodcell count in your body,</text><text start="733.26" dur="2.238">which helps you carry oxygen better.</text><text start="736.521" dur="3.715">Every morning, again,
after getting out of that tent,</text><text start="740.26" dur="2.976">your brain is completely wiped out.</text><text start="743.26" dur="3.976">My first attempt on pure O2,
I was able to go up to 15 minutes.</text><text start="747.899" dur="2.337">So, it was a pretty big success.</text><text start="750.26" dur="2.048">The neurosurgeon
pulled me out of the water</text><text start="752.332" dur="4.904">because in his mind, at 15 minutes
your brain is done, you&amp;#39;re brain dead.</text><text start="757.26" dur="2.339">So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.</text><text start="760.863" dur="3.349">There was one person there
that was definitely not impressed.</text><text start="765.022" dur="1.624">It was my ex-girlfriend.</text><text start="766.67" dur="3.46">While I was breaking the record
underwater for the first time,</text><text start="770.154" dur="3.082">she was sifting through my Blackberry,
checking all my messages.</text><text start="773.26" dur="2.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="776.26" dur="2.519">My brother had a picture of it.
It is really --</text><text start="778.803" dur="1.612">(Laughter)</text><text start="782.707" dur="1.001">(Laughter ends)</text><text start="783.732" dur="4.504">I then announced that I was going
to go for Sietas&amp;#39; record, publicly.</text><text start="788.26" dur="4.396">And what he did in response,
is he went on Regis and Kelly,</text><text start="793.26" dur="1.977">and broke his old record.</text><text start="795.261" dur="4.276">Then his main competitor
went out and broke his record.</text><text start="799.561" dur="4.675">So, he suddenly pushed the record up to
16 minutes and 32 seconds.</text><text start="804.26" dur="2.853">Which was three minutes
longer than I had prepared.</text><text start="807.137" dur="1.499">It was longer than the record.</text><text start="810.26" dur="3.976">I wanted to get the Science Times
to document this.</text><text start="814.26" dur="1.976">I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.</text><text start="816.838" dur="3.398">So, I did what any person</text><text start="820.26" dur="3.689">seriously pursuing scientific
advancement would do.</text><text start="823.973" dur="4.263">I walked into the New York Times offices
and did card tricks to everybody.</text><text start="828.26" dur="3.936">(Laughter)</text><text start="832.26" dur="3.381">So, I don&amp;#39;t know if it was the magic
or the lure of the Cayman Islands,</text><text start="835.665" dur="1.571">but John Tierney flew down</text><text start="837.26" dur="2.976">and did a piece on the seriousness
of breath-holding.</text><text start="840.26" dur="2.524">While he was there,
I tried to impress him, of course.</text><text start="842.808" dur="2.428">And I did a dive down to 160 feet,</text><text start="845.26" dur="4.486">which is basically the height
of a 16 story building,</text><text start="849.77" dur="2.466">and as I was coming up,
I blacked out underwater,</text><text start="852.26" dur="2.286">which is really dangerous;
that&amp;#39;s how you drown.</text><text start="854.57" dur="4.354">Luckily, Kirk had seen me
and he swam over and pulled me up.</text><text start="858.948" dur="2.288">So, I started full focus.</text><text start="861.26" dur="2.976">I completely trained to get
my breath-hold time up</text><text start="864.26" dur="1.976">for what I needed to do.</text><text start="866.26" dur="3.286">But there was no way to prepare
for the live television aspect of it,</text><text start="869.57" dur="1.666">being on Oprah.</text><text start="871.26" dur="4.649">But in practice, I would do it
face down, floating on the pool.</text><text start="875.933" dur="5.684">But for TV they wanted me to be upright
so they could see my face, basically.</text><text start="882.386" dur="3.85">The other problem
was the suit was so buoyant</text><text start="886.26" dur="2.976">that they had to strap my feet in
to keep me from floating up.</text><text start="889.26" dur="3.976">So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet
into the straps that were loose,</text><text start="893.26" dur="2.005">which was a real problem for me.</text><text start="896.331" dur="3.905">That made me extremely nervous,
raising the heart rate.</text><text start="900.26" dur="1.976">Then, what they also did was,</text><text start="902.26" dur="3.419">which we never did before,
is there was a heart-rate monitor.</text><text start="905.703" dur="2.533">And it was right next to the sphere.</text><text start="908.26" dur="3.239">So, every time my heart would beat,
I&amp;#39;d hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,</text><text start="911.523" dur="2.022">you know, the ticking, really loud.</text><text start="913.569" dur="2.144">Which was making me more nervous.</text><text start="915.737" dur="2.687">And there was no way to slow
my heart rate down.</text><text start="920.464" dur="3.772">Normally, I would start
at 38 beats per minute,</text><text start="924.26" dur="3.096">and while holding my breath,
it would drop to 12 beats per minute,</text><text start="927.38" dur="1.856">which is pretty unusual.</text><text start="929.26" dur="2.381">(Laughter)</text><text start="935.626" dur="4.771">This time it started at 120 beats,
and it never went down.</text><text start="941.618" dur="2.618">I spent the first five minutes underwater</text><text start="944.26" dur="2.976">desperately trying to slow
my heart rate down.</text><text start="947.26" dur="1.652">I was just sitting there thinking,</text><text start="948.936" dur="2.688">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got to slow this down.
I&amp;#39;m going to fail.&amp;quot;</text><text start="951.648" dur="1.588">And I was getting more nervous.</text><text start="953.26" dur="2.143">And the heart rate
just kept going up and up,</text><text start="955.427" dur="1.886">all the way up to 150 beats.</text><text start="960.247" dur="3.666">Basically it&amp;#39;s the same thing that created
my downfall at Lincoln Center.</text><text start="963.937" dur="1.357">It was a waste of O2.</text><text start="966.26" dur="2.524">When I made it to the halfway
mark, at eight minutes,</text><text start="968.808" dur="2.428">I was 100 percent certain</text><text start="971.26" dur="2.143">that I was not going
to be able to make this.</text><text start="973.427" dur="2.145">There was no way for me to do it.</text><text start="976.429" dur="2.807">I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour</text><text start="979.26" dur="2.976">to doing this breath-hold thing,
if I had cracked early,</text><text start="982.26" dur="2.976">it would be a whole show
about how depressed I am.</text><text start="985.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="987.26" dur="3.976">So, I figured I&amp;#39;m better off just fighting
and staying there until I black out,</text><text start="991.26" dur="3.239">at least then they can pull me out
and take care of me and all that.</text><text start="994.523" dur="3.109">(Laughter)</text><text start="998.26" dur="2.048">I kept pushing to 10 minutes.</text><text start="1000.332" dur="3.712">At 10 minutes you start getting all
these really strong tingling sensations</text><text start="1004.068" dur="1.58">in your fingers and toes.</text><text start="1005.672" dur="1.936">And I knew that that was blood shunting,</text><text start="1007.632" dur="2.494">when the blood rushes away
from your extremities</text><text start="1010.15" dur="2.121">to provide oxygen to your vital organs.</text><text start="1015.26" dur="4.611">At 11 minutes I started feeling
throbbing sensations in my legs,</text><text start="1019.895" dur="3.341">and my lips started
to feel really strange.</text><text start="1023.26" dur="3.976">At minute 12 I started
to have ringing in my ears,</text><text start="1027.26" dur="2.976">and I started to feel my arm going numb.</text><text start="1030.26" dur="3.239">And I&amp;#39;m a hypochondriac, and I remember
arm numb means heart attack.</text><text start="1033.523" dur="2.713">So, I started to really
get really paranoid.</text><text start="1037.291" dur="2.911">Then at 13 minutes, maybe
because of the hypochondria,</text><text start="1040.226" dur="4.01">I started feeling pains all over my chest.</text><text start="1044.26" dur="1.053">It was awful.</text><text start="1045.337" dur="1.001">(Laughter)</text><text start="1046.362" dur="3.874">At 14 minutes,
I had these awful contractions,</text><text start="1050.26" dur="1.976">like this urge to breathe.</text><text start="1052.26" dur="2.642">(Laughter)</text><text start="1058.131" dur="1">(Laughter ends)</text><text start="1060.26" dur="4.976">At 15 minutes I was suffering
major O2 deprivation to the heart.</text><text start="1065.26" dur="2.976">And I started having
ischemia to the heart.</text><text start="1068.26" dur="2.825">My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,</text><text start="1071.109" dur="5.127">to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.</text><text start="1076.26" dur="1.976">It would skip a beat.</text><text start="1078.26" dur="2.4">It would start. It would stop.
And I felt all this.</text><text start="1080.684" dur="2.667">And I was sure that I was going
to have a heart attack.</text><text start="1083.375" dur="2.861">So, at 16 minutes what I did
is I slid my feet out</text><text start="1086.26" dur="4.564">because I knew that if I did go out,
if I did have a heart attack,</text><text start="1090.848" dur="2.807">they&amp;#39;d have to jump into the binding
and take my feet out</text><text start="1093.679" dur="1.143">before pulling me up.</text><text start="1094.846" dur="1.384">I was really nervous.</text><text start="1096.254" dur="2.654">I let my feet out,
and I started floating to the top.</text><text start="1098.932" dur="1.507">And I didn&amp;#39;t take my head out.</text><text start="1100.463" dur="2.936">But I was just floating there
waiting for my heart to stop,</text><text start="1103.423" dur="1">just waiting.</text><text start="1104.447" dur="3.789">They had doctors with the &amp;quot;Pst,&amp;quot;
you know, sitting there waiting.</text><text start="1108.26" dur="2.543">And then suddenly I hear screaming.</text><text start="1110.827" dur="2.11">And I think that there
is some weird thing --</text><text start="1112.961" dur="2.275">that I had died or something had happened.</text><text start="1115.26" dur="3.976">And then I realized
that I had made it to 16:32.</text><text start="1119.26" dur="2.976">So, with the energy
of everybody that was there,</text><text start="1122.26" dur="1.976">I decided to keep pushing.</text><text start="1124.26" dur="2.446">And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.</text><text start="1126.73" dur="3.406">(Applause)</text><text start="1134.504" dur="1.732">(Applause ends)</text><text start="1136.26" dur="2.762">As though that wasn&amp;#39;t enough,
what I did immediately after</text><text start="1139.046" dur="1.39">is I went to Quest Labs</text><text start="1140.46" dur="2.504">and had them take every blood
sample that they could</text><text start="1142.988" dur="2.627">to test for everything
and to see where my levels were,</text><text start="1145.639" dur="1.99">so the doctors could use it, once again.</text><text start="1147.653" dur="2.016">I also didn&amp;#39;t want anybody to question it.</text><text start="1149.693" dur="3.543">I had the world record and I wanted
to make sure it was legitimate.</text><text start="1153.26" dur="2.976">So, I get to New York City the next day,</text><text start="1156.26" dur="3.239">I&amp;#39;m walking out of the Apple store,</text><text start="1159.523" dur="2.248">and this kid walks up to me
he&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Yo, D!&amp;quot;</text><text start="1161.795" dur="1.441">I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;Yeah?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1163.26" dur="2.976">He said, &amp;quot;If you really
held your breath that long,</text><text start="1166.26" dur="1.976">why&amp;#39;d you come out of the water dry?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1168.26" dur="1.976">I was like &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;</text><text start="1170.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="1172.26" dur="1.976">And that&amp;#39;s my life. So --</text><text start="1174.26" dur="4.132">(Laughter)</text><text start="1179.26" dur="2.096">As a magician,
I try to show things to people</text><text start="1181.38" dur="1.856">that seem impossible.</text><text start="1183.26" dur="1.481">And I think magic,</text><text start="1184.765" dur="3.471">whether I&amp;#39;m holding my breath
or shuffling a deck of cards,</text><text start="1188.26" dur="1.976">is pretty simple.</text><text start="1190.26" dur="3.582">It&amp;#39;s practice, it&amp;#39;s training,
and it&amp;#39;s -- (Sobs)</text><text start="1194.73" dur="2.792">It&amp;#39;s practice, it&amp;#39;s training
and experimenting,</text><text start="1197.546" dur="1.271">(Sobs)</text><text start="1198.841" dur="3.129">while pushing through the pain
to be the best that I can be.</text><text start="1201.994" dur="3.409">And that&amp;#39;s what magic
is to me, so, thank you.</text><text start="1205.427" dur="3.507">(Applause)</text></transcript>
