<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.883" dur="3.98">This is our life with bees,</text><text start="16.863" dur="3.723">and this is our life without bees.</text><text start="20.586" dur="2.468">Bees are the most important pollinators</text><text start="23.054" dur="2.809">of our fruits and vegetables and flowers</text><text start="25.863" dur="3.659">and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.</text><text start="29.522" dur="2.688">More than one third of the world&amp;#39;s crop production</text><text start="32.21" dur="2.782">is dependent on bee pollination.</text><text start="34.992" dur="2.837">But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there</text><text start="37.829" dur="2.917">pollinating our food intentionally.</text><text start="40.746" dur="2.871">They&amp;#39;re out there because they need to eat.</text><text start="43.617" dur="2.719">Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet</text><text start="46.336" dur="1.329">from pollen</text><text start="47.665" dur="2.936">and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.</text><text start="50.601" dur="1.765">They&amp;#39;re flower-feeders,</text><text start="52.366" dur="1.934">and as they move from flower to flower,</text><text start="54.3" dur="3.471">basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,</text><text start="57.771" dur="4.455">they end up providing this valuable pollination service.</text><text start="62.226" dur="2.52">In parts of the world where there are no bees,</text><text start="64.746" dur="2.906">or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,</text><text start="67.652" dur="4.206">people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.</text><text start="71.858" dur="3.684">These people are moving pollen from flower to flower</text><text start="75.542" dur="1.899">with a paintbrush.</text><text start="77.441" dur="2.446">Now this business of hand pollination</text><text start="79.887" dur="2.086">is actually not that uncommon.</text><text start="81.973" dur="3.352">Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers</text><text start="85.325" dur="2.657">with a hand-held vibrator.</text><text start="87.982" dur="3.944">Now this one&amp;#39;s the tomato tickler. (Laughter)</text><text start="91.926" dur="5.28">Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower</text><text start="97.206" dur="1.78">is held very securely within</text><text start="98.986" dur="2.5">the male part of the flower, the anther,</text><text start="101.486" dur="3.374">and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.</text><text start="104.86" dur="3.686">So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world</text><text start="108.546" dur="3.123">that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,</text><text start="111.669" dur="2.592">and they do this by shaking their flight muscles</text><text start="114.261" dur="4.552">at a frequency similar to the musical note C.</text><text start="118.813" dur="2.586">So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,</text><text start="121.399" dur="3.047">and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,</text><text start="124.446" dur="2.739">and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee&amp;#39;s body,</text><text start="127.185" dur="2.497">and she takes it home as food.</text><text start="129.682" dur="2.841">Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies</text><text start="132.523" dur="2.531">inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes</text><text start="135.054" dur="2.363">because they get much more efficient pollination</text><text start="137.417" dur="1.495">when it&amp;#39;s done naturally</text><text start="138.912" dur="3.562">and they get better quality tomatoes.</text><text start="142.474" dur="3.587">So there&amp;#39;s other, maybe more personal reasons,</text><text start="146.061" dur="1.423">to care about bees.</text><text start="147.484" dur="4.172">There&amp;#39;s over 20,000 species of bees in the world,</text><text start="151.656" dur="3.006">and they&amp;#39;re absolutely gorgeous.</text><text start="154.662" dur="2.619">These bees spend the majority of their life cycle</text><text start="157.281" dur="2.82">hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem</text><text start="160.101" dur="2.7">and very few of these beautiful species</text><text start="162.801" dur="3.433">have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.</text><text start="166.234" dur="3.62">Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative</text><text start="169.854" dur="3.169">for the other 19,900-plus species</text><text start="173.023" dur="2.641">because there&amp;#39;s something about honeybees</text><text start="175.664" dur="2.849">that draws people into their world.</text><text start="178.513" dur="2.447">Humans have been drawn to honeybees</text><text start="180.96" dur="1.716">since early recorded history,</text><text start="182.676" dur="1.476">mostly to harvest their honey,</text><text start="184.152" dur="3.459">which is an amazing natural sweetener.</text><text start="187.611" dur="1.788">I got drawn into the honeybee world</text><text start="189.399" dur="2.085">completely by a fluke.</text><text start="191.484" dur="2.322">I was 18 years old and bored,</text><text start="193.806" dur="2.862">and I picked up a book in the library on bees</text><text start="196.668" dur="2.242">and I spent the night reading it.</text><text start="198.91" dur="1.927">I had never thought about insects</text><text start="200.837" dur="1.723">living in complex societies.</text><text start="202.56" dur="3.402">It was like the best of science fiction come true.</text><text start="205.962" dur="2.894">And even stranger, there were these people,</text><text start="208.856" dur="3.991">these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,</text><text start="212.847" dur="3.303">and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.</text><text start="216.15" dur="2.485">So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,</text><text start="218.635" dur="4.197">a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.</text><text start="222.832" dur="3.407">And I was permanently hooked.</text><text start="226.239" dur="3.314">Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,</text><text start="229.553" dur="2.156">where the colony is the organism</text><text start="231.709" dur="2.732">and it&amp;#39;s comprised of 40,000 to 50,000</text><text start="234.441" dur="2.928">individual bee organisms.</text><text start="237.369" dur="3.332">Now this society has no central authority.</text><text start="240.701" dur="1.596">Nobody&amp;#39;s in charge.</text><text start="242.297" dur="2.345">So how they come to collective decisions,</text><text start="244.642" dur="2.98">and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,</text><text start="247.622" dur="2.482">how they communicate where the flowers are,</text><text start="250.104" dur="4.164">all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.</text><text start="254.268" dur="3.768">My personal favorite, and one that I&amp;#39;ve studied for many years,</text><text start="258.036" dur="1.945">is their system of healthcare.</text><text start="259.981" dur="3.485">So bees have social healthcare.</text><text start="263.466" dur="4.27">So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.</text><text start="267.736" dur="2.339">For example, we study hygiene,</text><text start="270.075" dur="2.886">where some bees are able to locate and weed out</text><text start="272.961" dur="3.167">sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,</text><text start="276.128" dur="2.464">and it keeps the colony healthy.</text><text start="278.592" dur="3.427">And more recently, we&amp;#39;ve been studying resins</text><text start="282.019" dur="2.109">that bees collect from plants.</text><text start="284.128" dur="3.183">So bees fly to some plants and they scrape</text><text start="287.311" dur="2.656">these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,</text><text start="289.967" dur="1.578">and they take them back to the nest</text><text start="291.545" dur="2.866">where they cement them into the nest architecture</text><text start="294.411" dur="2.525">where we call it propolis.</text><text start="296.936" dur="4.622">We&amp;#39;ve found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.</text><text start="301.558" dur="1.944">It&amp;#39;s a natural antibiotic.</text><text start="303.502" dur="3.179">It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs</text><text start="306.681" dur="1.602">within the colony,</text><text start="308.283" dur="3.963">and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.</text><text start="312.246" dur="3.291">Humans have known about the power of propolis</text><text start="315.537" dur="1.647">since biblical times.</text><text start="317.184" dur="3.35">We&amp;#39;ve been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies</text><text start="320.534" dur="2.052">for human medicine,</text><text start="322.586" dur="3.664">but we didn&amp;#39;t know how good it was for the bees.</text><text start="326.25" dur="4.053">So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses</text><text start="330.303" dur="2.689">that have kept them healthy and thriving</text><text start="332.992" dur="4.257">for over 50 million years.</text><text start="337.249" dur="3.349">So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies</text><text start="340.598" dur="1.799">were reported to be dying en masse,</text><text start="342.397" dur="1.972">first in the United States,</text><text start="344.369" dur="3.813">it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.</text><text start="348.182" dur="3.486">In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,</text><text start="351.668" dur="3.186">we know we can&amp;#39;t afford to lose bees.</text><text start="354.854" dur="3.115">So what&amp;#39;s going on?</text><text start="357.969" dur="4.089">Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,</text><text start="362.058" dur="2.482">and I&amp;#39;ll go through each of these.</text><text start="364.54" dur="1.853">The bottom line is,</text><text start="366.393" dur="4.052">bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape</text><text start="370.445" dur="3.489">and a dysfunctional food system.</text><text start="373.934" dur="1.992">Now we have the best data on honeybees,</text><text start="375.926" dur="1.856">so I&amp;#39;ll use them as an example.</text><text start="377.782" dur="3.493">In the United States, bees in fact have been</text><text start="381.275" dur="2.864">in decline since World War II.</text><text start="384.139" dur="2.274">We have half the number of managed hives</text><text start="386.413" dur="3.014">in the United States now compared to 1945.</text><text start="389.427" dur="3.651">We&amp;#39;re down to about two million hives of bees, we think.</text><text start="393.078" dur="2.746">And the reason is, after World War II,</text><text start="395.824" dur="3.328">we changed our farming practices.</text><text start="399.152" dur="2.839">We stopped planting cover crops.</text><text start="401.991" dur="2.743">We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,</text><text start="404.734" dur="3.846">which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,</text><text start="408.58" dur="3.604">and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.</text><text start="412.184" dur="5.544">Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.</text><text start="417.728" dur="3.454">And after World War II, we started using herbicides</text><text start="421.182" dur="2.497">to kill off the weeds in our farms.</text><text start="423.679" dur="2.781">Many of these weeds are flowering plants</text><text start="426.46" dur="2.933">that bees require for their survival.</text><text start="429.393" dur="5.571">And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.</text><text start="434.964" dur="2.565">Now we talk about food deserts,</text><text start="437.529" dur="4.25">places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.</text><text start="441.779" dur="4.043">The very farms that used to sustain bees</text><text start="445.822" dur="2.756">are now agricultural food deserts,</text><text start="448.578" dur="2.423">dominated by one or two plant species</text><text start="451.001" dur="2.589">like corn and soybeans.</text><text start="453.59" dur="2.905">Since World War II, we have been systematically</text><text start="456.495" dur="2.899">eliminating many of the flowering plants</text><text start="459.394" dur="3.552">that bees need for their survival.</text><text start="462.946" dur="2.898">And these monocultures extend even to crops</text><text start="465.844" dur="2.547">that are good for bees, like almonds.</text><text start="468.391" dur="3.986">Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,</text><text start="472.377" dur="3.011">hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,</text><text start="475.388" dur="3.932">and also because the pollen in an almond blossom</text><text start="479.32" dur="4.18">is really high in protein. It&amp;#39;s really good for bees.</text><text start="483.5" dur="3.997">Now, the scale of almond monoculture</text><text start="487.497" dur="2.552">demands that most of our nation&amp;#39;s bees,</text><text start="490.049" dur="2.736">over 1.5 million hives of bees,</text><text start="492.785" dur="2.992">be transported across the nation</text><text start="495.777" dur="2.351">to pollinate this one crop.</text><text start="498.128" dur="2.645">And they&amp;#39;re trucked in in semi-loads,</text><text start="500.773" dur="2.33">and they must be trucked out,</text><text start="503.103" dur="2.739">because after bloom, the almond orchards</text><text start="505.842" dur="5.21">are a vast and flowerless landscape.</text><text start="511.052" dur="2.466">Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,</text><text start="513.518" dur="3.805">and we&amp;#39;re planting more crops that need them.</text><text start="517.323" dur="4.184">There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production</text><text start="521.507" dur="3.804">that requires bee pollination.</text><text start="525.311" dur="3.026">And then there&amp;#39;s pesticides.</text><text start="528.337" dur="3.344">After World War II, we started using pesticides</text><text start="531.681" dur="2.564">on a large scale, and this became necessary</text><text start="534.245" dur="3.794">because of the monocultures that put out a feast</text><text start="538.039" dur="2.293">for crop pests.</text><text start="540.332" dur="2.941">Recently, researchers from Penn State University</text><text start="543.273" dur="3.297">have started looking at the pesticide residue</text><text start="546.57" dur="3.55">in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,</text><text start="550.12" dur="3.591">and they&amp;#39;ve found that every batch of pollen</text><text start="553.711" dur="2.007">that a honeybee collects</text><text start="555.718" dur="3.787">has at least six detectable pesticides in it,</text><text start="559.505" dur="4.043">and this includes every class of insecticides,</text><text start="563.548" dur="2.843">herbicides, fungicides,</text><text start="566.391" dur="3.58">and even inert and unlabeled ingredients</text><text start="569.971" dur="2.572">that are part of the pesticide formulation</text><text start="572.543" dur="4.222">that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.</text><text start="576.765" dur="5.642">This small bee is holding up a large mirror.</text><text start="582.407" dur="4.448">How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?</text><text start="586.855" dur="2.98">One of these class of insecticides,</text><text start="589.835" dur="1.375">the neonicontinoids,</text><text start="591.21" dur="2.26">is making headlines around the world right now.</text><text start="593.47" dur="1.446">You&amp;#39;ve probably heard about it.</text><text start="594.916" dur="2.058">This is a new class of insecticides.</text><text start="596.974" dur="3.159">It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,</text><text start="600.133" dur="1.443">a leaf-eating insect,</text><text start="601.576" dur="1.234">would take a bite of the plant</text><text start="602.81" dur="3.34">and get a lethal dose and die.</text><text start="606.15" dur="2.823">If one of these neonics, we call them,</text><text start="608.973" dur="2.454">is applied in a high concentration,</text><text start="611.427" dur="2.262">such as in this ground application,</text><text start="613.689" dur="2.468">enough of the compound moves through the plant</text><text start="616.157" dur="2.212">and gets into the pollen and the nectar,</text><text start="618.369" dur="2.104">where a bee can consume, in this case,</text><text start="620.473" dur="3.018">a high dose of this neurotoxin</text><text start="623.491" dur="4.149">that makes the bee twitch and die.</text><text start="627.64" dur="3.173">In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,</text><text start="630.813" dur="3.943">it&amp;#39;s only the seed that&amp;#39;s coated with the insecticide,</text><text start="634.756" dur="2.991">and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant</text><text start="637.747" dur="1.968">and gets into the pollen and nectar,</text><text start="639.715" dur="2.543">and if a bee consumes this lower dose,</text><text start="642.258" dur="1.342">either nothing happens</text><text start="643.6" dur="3.588">or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented</text><text start="647.188" dur="3.712">and she may not find her way home.</text><text start="650.9" dur="2.132">And on top of everything else, bees have</text><text start="653.032" dur="2.268">their own set of diseases and parasites.</text><text start="655.3" dur="2.86">Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.</text><text start="658.16" dur="2.305">It&amp;#39;s called varroa destructor.</text><text start="660.465" dur="1.104">It&amp;#39;s aptly named.</text><text start="661.569" dur="2.612">It&amp;#39;s this big, blood-sucking parasite</text><text start="664.181" dur="2.374">that compromises the bee&amp;#39;s immune system</text><text start="666.555" dur="2.771">and circulates viruses.</text><text start="669.326" dur="2.929">Let me put this all together for you.</text><text start="672.255" dur="2.667">I don&amp;#39;t know what it feels like to a bee</text><text start="674.922" dur="2.701">to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,</text><text start="677.623" dur="3.139">and I don&amp;#39;t know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,</text><text start="680.762" dur="5.128">but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,</text><text start="685.89" dur="3.232">and I know how difficult it is for me to get</text><text start="689.122" dur="2.789">to the grocery store to get good nutrition.</text><text start="691.911" dur="3.046">But what if I lived in a food desert?</text><text start="694.957" dur="2.495">And what if I had to travel a long distance</text><text start="697.452" dur="1.873">to get to the grocery store,</text><text start="699.325" dur="2.874">and I finally got my weak body out there</text><text start="702.199" dur="2.144">and I consumed, in my food,</text><text start="704.343" dur="2.801">enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,</text><text start="707.144" dur="2.756">that I couldn&amp;#39;t find my way home?</text><text start="709.9" dur="3.187">And this is what we mean by multiple</text><text start="713.087" dur="3.703">and interacting causes of death.</text><text start="716.79" dur="2.189">And it&amp;#39;s not just our honeybees.</text><text start="718.979" dur="2.875">All of our beautiful wild species of bees</text><text start="721.854" dur="4.171">are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.</text><text start="726.025" dur="3.551">These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.</text><text start="729.576" dur="2.05">They&amp;#39;re providing the pollination insurance</text><text start="731.626" dur="1.618">alongside our honeybees.</text><text start="733.244" dur="2.423">We need all of our bees.</text><text start="735.667" dur="2.541">So what are we going to do?</text><text start="738.208" dur="2.414">What are we

MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.</text><text start="925.586" dur="3.554">CA: Thirty percent a year.
MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies</text><text start="929.14" dur="2.65">and so they can maintain the same number,</text><text start="931.79" dur="2.321">they can recuperate some of their loss.</text><text start="934.111" dur="1.618">We&amp;#39;re kind of at a tipping point.</text><text start="935.729" dur="2.869">We can&amp;#39;t really afford to lose that many more.</text><text start="938.598" dur="1.82">We need to be really appreciative</text><text start="940.418" dur="3.353">of all the beekeepers out there.
