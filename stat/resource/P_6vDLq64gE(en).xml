<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="15.285" dur="4.951">Okay, now I don&amp;#39;t want
to alarm anybody in this room,</text><text start="20.26" dur="3.976">but it&amp;#39;s just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar.</text><text start="24.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="26.26" dur="2.976">Also, the person to your left is a liar.</text><text start="29.26" dur="2.976">Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar.</text><text start="32.26" dur="1.976">We&amp;#39;re all liars.</text><text start="34.26" dur="1.976">What I&amp;#39;m going to do today</text><text start="36.26" dur="3.576">is I&amp;#39;m going to show you what the research
says about why we&amp;#39;re all liars,</text><text start="39.86" dur="1.576">how you can become a liespotter</text><text start="41.46" dur="2.776">and why you might want
to go the extra mile</text><text start="44.26" dur="2.976">and go from liespotting to truth seeking,</text><text start="47.26" dur="1.976">and ultimately to trust building.</text><text start="49.26" dur="2.976">Now, speaking of trust,</text><text start="52.26" dur="2.976">ever since I wrote
this book, &amp;quot;Liespotting,&amp;quot;</text><text start="55.26" dur="2.976">no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no.</text><text start="58.26" dur="2.976">They say, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay, we&amp;#39;ll email you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="61.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="63.26" dur="3.976">I can&amp;#39;t even get
a coffee date at Starbucks.</text><text start="67.26" dur="1.976">My husband&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Honey, deception?</text><text start="69.26" dur="3.191">Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?&amp;quot;</text><text start="72.475" dur="2.143">So before I get started,
what I&amp;#39;m going to do</text><text start="74.642" dur="2.594">is I&amp;#39;m going to clarify my goal for you,</text><text start="77.26" dur="1.976">which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.</text><text start="79.26" dur="1.976">Liespotters aren&amp;#39;t those nitpicky kids,</text><text start="81.26" dur="3.334">those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, &amp;quot;Gotcha! Gotcha!</text><text start="84.618" dur="2.618">Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril.</text><text start="87.26" dur="2.976">I watch that TV show &amp;#39;Lie To Me.&amp;#39;
I know you&amp;#39;re lying.&amp;quot;</text><text start="90.26" dur="1.976">No, liespotters are armed</text><text start="92.26" dur="2.976">with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception.</text><text start="95.26" dur="1.976">They use it to get to the truth,</text><text start="97.26" dur="2.096">and they do what mature
leaders do everyday;</text><text start="99.38" dur="2.856">they have difficult conversations
with difficult people,</text><text start="102.26" dur="1.976">sometimes during very difficult times.</text><text start="104.26" dur="3.976">And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition,</text><text start="108.26" dur="1.976">and that proposition is the following:</text><text start="110.26" dur="2.468">Lying is a cooperative act.</text><text start="114.037" dur="3.199">Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance.</text><text start="117.26" dur="1.976">Its power emerges</text><text start="119.26" dur="2.096">when someone else agrees
to believe the lie.</text><text start="121.38" dur="1.976">So I know it may sound like tough love,</text><text start="123.38" dur="3.856">but look, if at some point
you got lied to,</text><text start="127.26" dur="1.976">it&amp;#39;s because you agreed to get lied to.</text><text start="129.26" dur="2.976">Truth number one about lying:
Lying&amp;#39;s a cooperative act.</text><text start="132.26" dur="1.976">Now not all lies are harmful.</text><text start="134.26" dur="2.976">Sometimes we&amp;#39;re willing
participants in deception</text><text start="137.26" dur="2.976">for the sake of social dignity,</text><text start="140.26" dur="2.976">maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret.</text><text start="143.26" dur="1.976">We say, &amp;quot;Nice song.&amp;quot;</text><text start="145.26" dur="2.976">&amp;quot;Honey, you don&amp;#39;t look fat in that, no.&amp;quot;</text><text start="148.26" dur="1.976">Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,</text><text start="150.26" dur="2.976">&amp;quot;You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder.</text><text start="153.26" dur="2.976">So sorry.&amp;quot;</text><text start="156.26" dur="3.239">But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception.</text><text start="159.523" dur="2.713">And that can have dramatic costs for us.</text><text start="162.26" dur="2.976">Last year saw 997 billion dollars</text><text start="165.26" dur="3.579">in corporate fraud alone
in the United States.</text><text start="169.593" dur="2.015">That&amp;#39;s an eyelash
under a trillion dollars.</text><text start="171.632" dur="1.604">That&amp;#39;s seven percent of revenues.</text><text start="173.26" dur="1.976">Deception can cost billions.</text><text start="175.26" dur="2.976">Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.</text><text start="178.26" dur="2.976">Or in the case
of double agents and traitors,</text><text start="181.26" dur="1.976">like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,</text><text start="183.26" dur="1.976">lies can betray our country,</text><text start="185.26" dur="3">they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy,</text><text start="188.284" dur="2.952">they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us.</text><text start="191.26" dur="2.976">Deception is actually serious business.</text><text start="194.26" dur="3.976">This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man,</text><text start="198.26" dur="1.976">British authorities say</text><text start="200.26" dur="3.476">he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world.</text><text start="203.76" dur="3.176">And you can&amp;#39;t find this guy on Google;
you can&amp;#39;t find him anywhere.</text><text start="206.96" dur="2.476">He was interviewed once,
and he said the following.</text><text start="209.46" dur="1.676">He said, &amp;quot;Look, I&amp;#39;ve got one rule.&amp;quot;</text><text start="211.16" dur="2.076">And this was Henry&amp;#39;s rule, he said,</text><text start="213.26" dur="2.376">&amp;quot;Look, everyone is willing
to give you something.</text><text start="215.66" dur="3.572">They&amp;#39;re ready to give you something
for whatever it is they&amp;#39;re hungry for.&amp;quot;</text><text start="219.256" dur="1.38">And that&amp;#39;s the crux of it.</text><text start="220.66" dur="2.429">If you don&amp;#39;t want to be
deceived, you have to know,</text><text start="223.113" dur="1.676">what is it that you&amp;#39;re hungry for?</text><text start="224.813" dur="2.423">And we all kind of hate to admit it.</text><text start="227.26" dur="2.976">We wish we were
better husbands, better wives,</text><text start="230.26" dur="3.976">smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --</text><text start="234.26" dur="1.976">the list goes on.</text><text start="236.26" dur="1.976">Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,</text><text start="238.26" dur="1.976">to connect our wishes and our fantasies</text><text start="240.26" dur="2.976">about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be,</text><text start="243.26" dur="2.976">with what we&amp;#39;re really like.</text><text start="246.26" dur="3.239">And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies.</text><text start="249.523" dur="2.713">On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to</text><text start="252.26" dur="1.976">anywhere from 10 to 200 times.</text><text start="254.26" dur="2.976">Now granted, many of those are white lies.</text><text start="257.26" dur="1.976">But in another study,</text><text start="259.26" dur="1.976">it showed that strangers lied three times</text><text start="261.26" dur="2.381">within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other.</text><text start="263.665" dur="1.571">(Laughter)</text><text start="265.26" dur="2.976">Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil.</text><text start="268.26" dur="1.976">We can&amp;#39;t believe how prevalent lying is.</text><text start="270.26" dur="1.976">We&amp;#39;re essentially against lying.</text><text start="272.26" dur="3.976">But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens.</text><text start="276.26" dur="2.976">We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers.</text><text start="279.26" dur="3.976">Extroverts lie more than introverts.</text><text start="283.26" dur="4.976">Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people.</text><text start="288.26" dur="2.976">Women lie more to protect other people.</text><text start="291.26" dur="2.976">If you&amp;#39;re an average married couple,</text><text start="294.26" dur="3.976">you&amp;#39;re going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions.</text><text start="298.26" dur="1.976">Now, you may think that&amp;#39;s bad.</text><text start="300.26" dur="2.286">If you&amp;#39;re unmarried,
that number drops to three.</text><text start="302.57" dur="1.666">Lying&amp;#39;s complex.</text><text start="304.26" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives.</text><text start="307.284" dur="1.952">We&amp;#39;re deeply ambivalent about the truth.</text><text start="309.26" dur="1.976">We parse it out on an as-needed basis,</text><text start="311.26" dur="1.976">sometimes for very good reasons,</text><text start="313.26" dur="3.191">other times just because
we don&amp;#39;t understand the gaps in our lives.</text><text start="316.475" dur="1.761">That&amp;#39;s truth number two about lying.</text><text start="318.26" dur="1.976">We&amp;#39;re against lying,</text><text start="320.26" dur="1.976">but we&amp;#39;re covertly for it</text><text start="322.26" dur="4">in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries.</text><text start="326.284" dur="1.952">It&amp;#39;s as old as breathing.</text><text start="328.26" dur="2.429">It&amp;#39;s part of our culture,
it&amp;#39;s part of our history.</text><text start="330.713" dur="5.523">Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World.</text><text start="336.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="338.26" dur="2.286">Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species.</text><text start="340.57" dur="3.666">Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species,</text><text start="344.26" dur="1.976">the larger the neocortex,</text><text start="346.26" dur="1.976">the more likely it is to be deceptive.</text><text start="348.26" dur="1.976">Now you might remember Koko.</text><text start="350.26" dur="3.239">Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language?</text><text start="353.523" dur="2.713">Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language.</text><text start="356.26" dur="1.976">Here&amp;#39;s Koko with her kitten.</text><text start="358.26" dur="2.976">It&amp;#39;s her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.</text><text start="361.26" dur="3.976">Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall.</text><text start="365.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="367.26" dur="2.191">We&amp;#39;re hardwired to become
leaders of the pack.</text><text start="369.475" dur="1.761">It&amp;#39;s starts really, really early.</text><text start="371.26" dur="1.976">How early?</text><text start="373.26" dur="1.976">Well babies will fake a cry,</text><text start="375.26" dur="1.976">pause, wait to see who&amp;#39;s coming</text><text start="377.26" dur="1.976">and then go right back to crying.</text><text start="379.26" dur="1.976">One-year-olds learn concealment.</text><text start="381.26" dur="1.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="383.26" dur="1.976">Two-year-olds bluff.</text><text start="385.26" dur="1.976">Five-year-olds lie outright.</text><text start="387.26" dur="1.976">They manipulate via flattery.</text><text start="389.26" dur="2.976">Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.</text><text start="392.26" dur="1.976">By the time you enter college,</text><text start="394.26" dur="3.376">you&amp;#39;re going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions.</text><text start="397.66" dur="2.876">By the time we enter this work world
and we&amp;#39;re breadwinners,</text><text start="400.56" dur="3.676">we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends,</text><text start="404.26" dur="1.976">partisan media,</text><text start="406.26" dur="1.976">ingenious identity thieves,</text><text start="408.26" dur="1.976">world-class Ponzi schemers,</text><text start="410.26" dur="1.976">a deception epidemic --</text><text start="412.26" dur="4.977">in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society.</text><text start="417.261" dur="3.965">It&amp;#39;s been very confusing
for a long time now.</text><text start="423.925" dur="1.311">What do you do?</text><text start="425.26" dur="3.976">Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass.</text><text start="429.26" dur="2.976">Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time.</text><text start="432.26" dur="2.976">The rest of us,
we&amp;#39;re only 54 percent accurate.</text><text start="435.26" dur="1.976">Why is it so easy to learn?</text><text start="437.26" dur="2.215">There are good liars and bad liars.</text><text start="439.499" dur="1.637">There are no real original liars.</text><text start="441.16" dur="2.976">We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques.</text><text start="444.16" dur="3.629">So what I&amp;#39;m going to do is I&amp;#39;m going
to show you two patterns of deception.</text><text start="447.813" dur="2.199">And then we&amp;#39;re going
to look at the hot spots</text><text start="450.036" dur="1.853">and see if we can find them ourselves.</text><text start="451.913" dur="1.623">We&amp;#39;re going to start with speech.</text><text start="453.56" dur="2.334">(Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me.</text><text start="455.918" dur="1.418">I&amp;#39;m going to say this again.</text><text start="457.36" dur="6.876">I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.</text><text start="464.26" dur="3.976">I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never.</text><text start="468.26" dur="2.976">And these allegations are false.</text><text start="471.26" dur="2.572">And I need to go back to work
for the American people.</text><text start="473.856" dur="1.976">Thank you.</text><text start="475.856" dur="1.512">(Applause)</text><text start="478.26" dur="2.976">Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs?</text><text start="481.26" dur="3.976">Well first we heard what&amp;#39;s known
as a non-contracted denial.</text><text start="485.26" dur="3">Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial</text><text start="488.284" dur="2.952">will resort to formal rather
than informal language.</text><text start="491.26" dur="2.976">We also heard
distancing language: &amp;quot;that woman.&amp;quot;</text><text start="494.26" dur="2.715">We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves</text><text start="496.999" dur="1.237">from their subject,</text><text start="498.26" dur="2.976">using language as their tool.</text><text start="501.26" dur="3.048">Now if Bill Clinton had said,
&amp;quot;Well, to tell you the truth ...&amp;quot;</text><text start="504.332" dur="2.291">or Richard Nixon&amp;#39;s favorite,
&amp;quot;In all candor ...&amp;quot;</text><text start="506.647" dur="1.689">he would have been a dead giveaway</text><text start="508.36" dur="1.876">for any liespotter that knows</text><text start="510.26" dur="3.429">that qualifying language, as it&amp;#39;s called,
qualifying language like that,</text><text start="513.713" dur="1.523">further discredits the subject.</text><text start="515.26" dur="2.976">Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety,</text><text start="518.26" dur="3.976">or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail --</text><text start="522.26" dur="2.191">and we&amp;#39;re all really glad
he didn&amp;#39;t do that --</text><text start="524.475" dur="2">he would have further discredited himself.</text><text start="526.499" dur="1.737">Freud had it right.</text><text start="528.26" dur="2.976">Freud said, look,
there&amp;#39;s much more to it than speech:</text><text start="531.26" dur="2.976">&amp;quot;No mortal can keep a secret.</text><text start="534.26" dur="2.976">If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips.&amp;quot;</text><text start="537.26" dur="2.976">And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are.</text><text start="540.26" dur="1.976">We all chatter with our fingertips.</text><text start="542.26" dur="2.976">I&amp;#39;m going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama</text><text start="545.26" dur="2.976">who&amp;#39;s chattering with his fingertips.</text><text start="548.26" dur="2.976">(Laughter)</text><text start="551.26" dur="5.976">Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language.</text><text start="557.26" dur="2.976">With body language,
here&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ve got to do.</text><text start="560.26" dur="2.976">You&amp;#39;ve really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door.</text><text start="563.26" dur="2.429">Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit.</text><text start="565.713" dur="2.523">Because we think liars
fidget all the time.</text><text start="568.26" dur="3.762">Well guess what, they&amp;#39;re known to freeze
their upper bodies when they&amp;#39;re lying.</text><text start="572.046" dur="2.19">We think liars won&amp;#39;t look you in the eyes.</text><text start="574.26" dur="2.876">Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much</text><text start="577.16" dur="1.576">just to compensate for that myth.</text><text start="578.76" dur="3.476">We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity.</text><text start="582.26" dur="3.976">But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away.</text><text start="586.26" dur="3">Can you all spot the fake smile here?</text><text start="590.26" dur="4.976">You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks.</text><text start="595.26" dur="2.976">But the real smile&amp;#39;s in the eyes,
the crow&amp;#39;s feet of the eyes.</text><text start="598.26" dur="1.976">They cannot be consciously contracted,</text><text start="600.26" dur="1.976">especially if you overdid the Botox.</text><text start="602.26" dur="2.976">Don&amp;#39;t overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you&amp;#39;re honest.</text><text start="605.26" dur="1.976">Now we&amp;#39;re going to look at the hot spots.</text><text start="607.26" dur="2.286">Can you tell what&amp;#39;s happening
in a conversation?</text><text start="609.57" dur="2.666">Can you start to find the hot spots</text><text start="612.26" dur="1.976">to see the discrepancies</text><text start="614.26" dur="2.191">between someone&amp;#39;s words
and someone&amp;#39;s actions?</text><text start="616.475" dur="1.761">Now, I know it seems really obvious,</text><text start="618.26" dur="4.976">but when you&amp;#39;re having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception,</text><text start="623.26" dur="3.076">attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators.</text><text start="626.36" dur="2.196">An honest person
is going to be cooperative.</text><text start="628.58" dur="2.048">They&amp;#39;re going to show
they&amp;#39;re on your side.</text><text start="630.652" dur="1.584">They&amp;#39;re going to be enthusiastic.</text><text start="632.26" dur="3.276">They&amp;#39;re going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth.</text><text start="635.56" dur="2.776">They&amp;#39;re going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects,</text><text start="638.36" dur="1.276">provide details.</text><text start="639.66" dur="1.576">They&amp;#39;re going to say,</text><text start="641.26" dur="3.176">&amp;quot;Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks.&amp;quot;</text><text start="644.46" dur="3.276">They&amp;#39;re going to be infuriated
if they sense they&amp;#39;re wrongly accused</text><text start="647.76" dur="3.176">throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes;</text><text start="650.96" dur="3.239">they&amp;#39;ll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview.</text><text start="654.223" dur="1.413">And if you ask someone honest</text><text start="655.66" dur="2.576">what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks,</text><text start="658.26" dur="1.776">an honest person is much more likely</text><text start="660.06" dur="3.176">to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment.</text><text start="663.26" dur="2.667">Now let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re having
that exact same conversation</text><text start="665.951" dur="1.285">with someone deceptive.</text><text start="667.26" dur="1.976">That person may be withdrawn,</text><text start="669.26" dur="1.976">look down, lower their voice,</text><text start="671.26" dur="1.976">pause, be kind of herky-jerky.</text><text start="673.26" dur="2.048">Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story,</text><text start="675.332" dur="2.904">they&amp;#39;re going to pepper it
with way too much detail</text><text start="678.26" dur="2.976">in all kinds of irrelevant places.</text><text start="681.26" dur="3.476">And then they&amp;#39;re going to tell their story
in strict chronological order.</text><text start="684.76" dur="1.776">And what a trained interrogator does</text><text start="686.56" dur="3.676">is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours,</text><text start="690.26" dur="2.976">they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards,</text><text start="693.26" dur="1.976">and then they&amp;#39;ll watch them squirm,</text><text start="695.26" dur="3.429">and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells.</text><text start="698.713" dur="2.523">Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing.</text><text start="701.26" dur="1.976">We rehearse our words,</text><text start="703.26" dur="1.976">but we rarely rehearse our gestures.</text><text start="705.26" dur="1.976">We say &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; we shake our heads &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;</text><text start="707.26" dur="3.096">We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders.</text><text start="710.38" dur="1.856">We commit terrible crimes,</text><text start="712.26" dur="2.976">and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it.</text><text start="715.26" dur="2.976">Now, that smile is known
in the trade as &amp;quot;duping delight.&amp;quot;</text><text start="718.26" dur="2.976">And we&amp;#39;re going to see that
in several videos moving forward,</text><text start="721.26" dur="3.076">but we&amp;#39;re going to start --
for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know him,</text><text start="724.36" dur="2.076">this is presidential
candidate John Edwards</text><text start="726.46" dur="2.776">who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock.</text><text start="729.26" dur="2.976">We&amp;#39;re going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test.</text><text start="732.26" dur="4">See now if you can spot him
saying, &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; while shaking his head &amp;quot;no,&amp;quot;</text><text start="736.284" dur="1.952">slightly shrugging his shoulders.</text><text start="738.26" dur="2.676">(Video) John Edwards: I&amp;#39;d be happy
to participate in one.</text><text start="740.96" dur="2.876">I know that it&amp;#39;s not possible
that this child could be mine,</text><text start="743.86" dur="1.576">because of the timing of events.</text><text start="745.46" dur="1.776">So I know it&amp;#39;s not possible.</text><text start="747.26" dur="3.976">Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen.</text><text start="751.26" dur="3.048">Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody --</text><text start="754.332" dur="2.904">JE: Well, I&amp;#39;m only one side.
I&amp;#39;m only one side of the test.</text><text start="757.26" dur="2.604">But I&amp;#39;m happy to participate in one.</text><text start="761.055" dur="2.434">PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot</text><text start="763.513" dur="1.523">once you know to look for them.</text><text start="765.06" dur="3.976">There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression</text><text start="769.06" dur="3.176">while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash.</text><text start="772.26" dur="1.976">Murderers are known to leak sadness.</text><text start="774.26" dur="2.576">Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand,</text><text start="776.86" dur="4.376">celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger.</text><text start="781.26" dur="3.576">And we&amp;#39;re not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here,</text><text start="784.86" dur="2.478">but there&amp;#39;s one I can teach you
that&amp;#39;s very dangerous</text><text start="787.362" dur="1.213">and it&amp;#39;s easy to learn,</text><text start="788.599" dur="1.837">and that&amp;#39;s the expression of contempt.</text><text start="790.46" dur="3">Now with anger, you&amp;#39;ve got
two people on an even playing field.</text><text start="793.484" dur="2.191">It&amp;#39;s still somewhat
of a healthy relationship.</text><text start="795.699" dur="3.537">But when anger turns to contempt,
you&amp;#39;ve been dismissed.</text><text start="799.26" dur="1.976">It&amp;#39;s associated with moral superiority.</text><text start="801.26" dur="2.976">And for that reason, it&amp;#39;s very,
very hard to recover from.</text><text start="804.26" dur="1.976">Here&amp;#39;s what it looks like.</text><text start="806.26" dur="3.976">It&amp;#39;s marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in.</text><text start="810.26" dur="2.976">It&amp;#39;s the only asymmetrical expression.</text><text start="813.26" dur="3.976">And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows --</text><text start="817.26" dur="1.976">and it doesn&amp;#39;t always follow --</text><text start="819.26" dur="2.048">look the other way,
go the other direction,</text><text start="821.332" dur="1.904">reconsider the deal,</text><text start="823.26" dur="3.976">say, &amp;quot;No thank you. I&amp;#39;m not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="827.26" dur="3.976">Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators.</text><text start="831.26" dur="1.976">We know, for example,</text><text start="833.26" dur="2">we know liars will shift their blink rate,</text><text start="835.284" dur="1.952">point their feet towards an exit.</text><text start="837.26" dur="1.976">They will take barrier objects</text><text start="839.26" dur="3.429">and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them.</text><text start="842.713" dur="1.523">They&amp;#39;ll alter their vocal tone,</text><text start="844.26" dur="2.976">often making their vocal tone much lower.</text><text start="847.26" dur="1.976">Now here&amp;#39;s the deal.</text><text start="849.26" dur="2.976">These behaviors are just behaviors.</text><text start="852.26" dur="1.976">They&amp;#39;re not proof of deception.</text><text start="854.26" dur="1.976">They&amp;#39;re red flags.</text><text start="856.26" dur="1.976">We&amp;#39;re human beings.</text><text start="858.26" dur="3.276">We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long.</text><text start="861.56" dur="2.191">They don&amp;#39;t mean anything
in and of themselves.</text><text start="863.775" dur="2.561">But when you see clusters
of them, that&amp;#39;s your signal.</text><text start="866.36" dur="2.876">Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions,</text><text start="869.26" dur="2.976">get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing,</text><text start="872.26" dur="2.976">walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions,</text><text start="875.26" dur="3.376">have a little dignity, treat the person
you&amp;#39;re talking to with rapport.</text><text start="878.66" dur="3.576">Don&amp;#39;t try to be like those folks
on &amp;quot;Law &amp;amp; Order&amp;quot; and those other TV shows</text><text start="882.26" dur="2.048">that pummel their subjects
into submission.</text><text start="884.332" dur="2.004">Don&amp;#39;t be too aggressive, it doesn&amp;#39;t work.</text><text start="887.379" dur="3.357">Now, we&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who&amp;#39;s lying</text><text start="890.76" dur="1.476">and how to spot a lie.</text><text start="892.26" dur="3.476">And as I promised, we&amp;#39;re now going
to look at what the truth looks like.</text><text start="895.76" dur="1.776">But I&amp;#39;m going to show you two videos,</text><text start="897.56" dur="2.676">two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth.</text><text start="900.26" dur="4.096">And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California.</text><text start="904.38" dur="3.856">And I think they&amp;#39;re an excellent example
of what the truth looks like.</text><text start="908.26" dur="1.976">This mother, Diane Downs,</text><text start="910.26" dur="1.976">shot her kids at close range,</text><text start="912.26" dur="3.976">drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car,</text><text start="916.26" dur="1.976">claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.</text><text start="918.26" dur="1.976">And you&amp;#39;ll see when you see the video,</text><text start="920.26" dur="2.334">she can&amp;#39;t even pretend
to be an agonizing mother.</text><text start="922.618" dur="3.618">What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy</text><text start="926.26" dur="3.976">between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor.</text><text start="930.26" dur="3.476">And if you look closely, you&amp;#39;ll see
duping delight throughout this video.</text><text start="933.76" dur="2.476">(Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes,</text><text start="936.26" dur="3.096">I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I&amp;#39;m driving,</text><text start="939.38" dur="2.256">and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth.</text><text start="941.66" dur="2.143">And that -- maybe
it&amp;#39;ll fade too with time --</text><text start="943.827" dur="1.409">but I don&amp;#39;t think so.</text><text start="945.26" dur="3">That bothers me the most.</text><text start="955.26" dur="1.976">PM: Now I&amp;#39;m going to show you a video</text><text start="957.26" dur="2.048">of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion,</text><text start="959.332" dur="3.904">confronting her daughter&amp;#39;s murderer
and torturer in court.</text><text start="963.26" dur="2">Here you&amp;#39;re going to see no false emotion,</text><text start="965.284" dur="2.952">just the authentic expression
of a mother&amp;#39;s agony.</text><text start="968.26" dur="2.091">(Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement</text><text start="970.375" dur="2.661">on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby,</text><text start="973.06" dur="1.276">and you hurt her,</text><text start="974.36" dur="1.876">and you crushed her,</text><text start="976.26" dur="3.976">you terrified her until her heart stopped.</text><text start="980.26" dur="2.976">And she fought, and I know she fought you.</text><text start="983.26" dur="3.976">But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes,</text><text start="987.26" dur="2.976">and you still wanted to kill her.</text><text start="990.26" dur="1.976">And I don&amp;#39;t understand it,</text><text start="992.26" dur="1.547">and I never will.</text><text start="995.91" dur="3.326">PM: Okay, there&amp;#39;s no doubting
the veracity of those emotions.</text><text start="999.26" dur="2.976">Now the technology
around what the truth looks like</text><text start="1002.26" dur="2.976">is progressing on, the science of it.</text><text start="1005.26" dur="1.976">We know, for example,</text><text start="1007.26" dur="3.143">that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans,</text><text start="1010.427" dur="2.809">MRI&amp;#39;s that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out</text><text start="1013.26" dur="1.976">when we&amp;#39;re trying to be deceptive.</text><text start="1015.26" dur="2.976">And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us</text><text start="1018.26" dur="1.976">as panaceas for deceit,</text><text start="1020.26" dur="2.976">and they will prove
incredibly useful some day.</text><text start="1023.26" dur="2.239">But you&amp;#39;ve got to ask yourself
in the meantime:</text><text start="1025.523" dur="2.096">Who do you want on your side
of the meeting,</text><text start="1027.643" dur="2.593">someone who&amp;#39;s trained
in getting to the truth</text><text start="1030.26" dur="3.076">or some guy who&amp;#39;s going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram</text><text start="1033.36" dur="1.276">through the door?</text><text start="1034.66" dur="3.576">Liespotters rely on human tools.</text><text start="1038.26" dur="1.976">They know, as someone once said,</text><text start="1040.26" dur="1.976">&amp;quot;Character&amp;#39;s who you are in the dark.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1042.26" dur="3.976">And what&amp;#39;s kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness.</text><text start="1046.26" dur="2.976">Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.</text><text start="1049.26" dur="3.976">It&amp;#39;s transparent
with blogs and social networks</text><text start="1053.26" dur="2.676">broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people</text><text start="1055.96" dur="2.576">that have made a choice to live
their lives in public.</text><text start="1058.56" dur="3.676">It&amp;#39;s a much more noisy world.</text><text start="1062.26" dur="3.976">So one challenge we have is to remember,</text><text start="1066.26" dur="2.976">oversharing, that&amp;#39;s not honesty.</text><text start="1069.26" dur="3.976">Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us</text><text start="1073.26" dur="3.576">to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity --</text><text start="1076.86" dur="3.048">that&amp;#39;s still what matters,
that&amp;#39;s always what&amp;#39;s going to matter.</text><text start="1079.932" dur="1.504">So in this much noisier world,</text><text start="1081.46" dur="1.776">it might make sense for us</text><text start="1083.26" dur="4.976">to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code.</text><text start="1088.26" dur="2.576">When you combine the science
of recognizing deception</text><text start="1090.86" dur="1.676">with the art of looking, listening,</text><text start="1092.56" dur="2.676">you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie.</text><text start="1095.26" dur="3.976">You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit,</text><text start="1099.26" dur="2">because you signal to everyone around you,</text><text start="1101.284" dur="4.952">you say, &amp;quot;Hey, my world, our world,
it&amp;#39;s going to be an honest one.</text><text start="1106.26" dur="2.62">My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened</text><text start="1108.904" dur="2.332">and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1111.26" dur="1.976">And when you do that,</text><text start="1113.26" dur="2.976">the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit.</text><text start="1116.26" dur="2.976">And that&amp;#39;s the truth. Thank you.</text><text start="1119.26" dur="5">(Applause)</text></transcript>
